Don't combine any of these with another activity, like listening to music, talking on the phone, etc. This is distraction; it doesn't allow your mind space.\n\n The more, the better. Try to incorporate it in your daily life. Feel free to also go for a long hike!\n\n It will be uncomfortable, but it will be worth it.

You want to workout: You know that you need to dress up, you need to drive / walk to the gym you need to dress up again then you need to warm up then you need to hit your PR and its going to bo a long boring session also you will feel tired and pain and blah blah blah   \nYou think through this because you already had bad experiences with working out or never really worked out so you afraid of the unknown or you just feel that its something that you have to do but you don\'t really want to do.   \nSo what you should do is make only small steps. Don\'t think about the whole workout or the possiblities that may can happen. Forget everything about it for a moment. Only think about "I\'m just dressing up and thats it". This is the only task you have to do. Find your cloths and dress up. Then you already did the first step so all you have to worry about is to drive / walk to the gym. You don\'t have to change your cloths or something your only task is to sit down in the dressing room. If you feel its enough then go home but trust me seeing all those people in the dressing room will make you realise that you can achive this aswell. So start to think only about changing your cloths. Don\'t think about warming up or working out and so on... then your only goal is to warm up...then your only  goal is to start to workout ... and if you feel like, break your last PR because why not. Main point is to break huge problems into very small easily doable tasks and let yourself push through your steps but only 1 task at a time. \n2. You want to study: You already think about those boring pages OMG its like 30 page that I have to learn in one night and what if I can\'t focus and how long will it takes and what if ... blah blah blah. Again... first step: "my only task is to put away my phone and find  the necessary books and put it on the table ... thats it nothing else to worry about...." after you did this ... all right I will just mark the important pages in the book so I will have much easier time when I want to study a bit.... if you are in the mood then you should run through the first subject? You already sit down an you already marked the most important titles and you ran through the first subject so you are well prepared to study a little bit. But only the first subject! Don\'t even think about other subjects until you already know the first subject. Then run through the second one maybe its easier than the previous and so on... \n3. You want to work: Same... instead of thinking about the whole project just write a short outline/draft..it is your only job, maybe do the rest next day who knows don\'t care about this right now... If you finished your outline check the first step and maybe do that. Its like just 5-10 minutes why not... then maybe do the 2nd task and so on.  \n\n\nMain point is go forward in small steps don\'t worry about the unknown future it doesn\'t exist yet. Yes it can be possible that you will feel tired or fustrated during the upcoming workout or work session but maybe it will be one of your best day when you will nail every task. Worry about something that doesn\'t exists yet makes everything harder. **We tend to focus only on the negative side of the things instead counting with the positive possiblities aswell.** Yes maybe you didn\'t break your PR but you got your lazy ass up, went to the gym, dressed up, worked out etc so you already finished 90% of your goals.

Since then, I have significantly progressed in life, I\'ve gained 50 lbs of muscle naturally, learned about psychology/ decreasing depression and became more social.\n\nThe key word is, "more social" to the extent that someone can when they are "off-the-grid" of social media. I have been feeling withdrawal effects more and more recently, as it seems many businesses use social media, self-improvement YouTubers I watch also use it. But I know deep down, it will corrupt me, I need not mention how much negative impact apps like TikTok have had on today\'s youth.\n\nOn the one hand, not having socials has allowed me to finish college with no debt, 2 years quicker than people my age, it helped me study and pursue several careers at once, allowed me to practice my faith more, learn different skills, and bettered my outlook on life. On the flip side of that coin, I don\'t know what my childhood friends are doing, I\'m not up to date on all the buzz topics and feel recluse.\n\nNow, I still go out and touch the grass! I have friends, a significant other, and all that, but mentally I have a fear of missing out. What if social media would unlock opportunities in life that I otherwise wouldn\'t have? What if I can use it maturely and filter out the dirt from the gold? What if I could continue progressing whilst having socials?

I feel more motivated, clear, content, and calm, while getting to know myself more and increasing my self-awareness.\n\n It's **changing** my life, and so it can yours. Here is how:\n\n Giving your mind space allows your unconscious to orientate and help you. It organizes and declutters your mind, while exploring and processing your thoughts and feelings.\n\n You'll gradually discover what you actually think, how you are feeling, what you really want, what you actually value... and actually feel like doing things!\n\n We've lost mental space, because of all these distractions we engage in. Sitting with yourself, sitting *through* your boredom, will allow you to reclaim yourself.\n\n This is different from meditation; you want your mind to wander, but you can also try to alternate it with trying to be present.\n\n **Alternatives** that allow your mind space:\n\n Going for a walk (such a great thing by itself!), doing a puzzle, coloring a coloring book, cleaning, organizing, journaling, exercising, not being on your phone while waiting for something, and there are many more!\n\n It's about doing *one* thing for the sake of doing the thing (so without a clear mental goal). Don't combine any of these with another activity, like listening to music, talking on the phone, etc. This is distraction; it doesn't allow your mind space.\n\n The more, the better. Try to incorporate it in your daily life. Feel free to also go for a long hike!\n\n It will be uncomfortable, but it will be worth it. I'd encourage you to try it out and see for yourself!\n\n Reclaim yourself; reclaim your life :)"), ('11bfqti', 8, 277, 't5_2qh1k', 'productivity', "If you feel fear or unmotivated / overwhelmed by the upcoming tasks or you can't force yourself to start it...", datetime.datetime(2023, 2, 25, 17, 10, 51), 'https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/11bfqti/if_you_feel_fear_or_unmotivated_overwhelmed_by/', 'Keep this in mind: "**even the smallest step moves you forward**"  \n\n\nOur brain is a very complex organ it tries to process the next 10 steps so we see everything much bigger than it is.   \nIf you often feel overwhelmed or unmotivated by the upcoming task its because there are too much unknown steps in it or you had bad experience at least once during a similar task.   \nTo solve this issue **forget the whole task focus only on the first step and don\'t worry about anything else.**   \n3 example:\n\n1. You want to workout: You know that you need to dress up, you need to drive / walk to the gym you need to dress up again then you need to warm up then you need to hit your PR and its going to bo a long boring session also you will feel tired and pain and blah blah blah   \nYou think through this because you already had bad experiences with working out or never really worked out so you afraid of the unknown or you just feel that its something that you have to do but you don\'t really want to do.   \nSo what you should do is make only small steps. Don\'t think about the whole workout or the possiblities that may can happen. Forget everything about it for a moment. Only think about "I\'m just dressing up and thats it". This is the only task you have to do. Find your cloths and dress up. Then you already did the first step so all you have to worry about is to drive / walk to the gym. You don\'t have to change your cloths or something your only task is to sit down in the dressing room. If you feel its enough then go home but trust me seeing all those people in the dressing room will make you realise that you can achive this aswell. So start to think only about changing your cloths. Don\'t think about warming up or working out and so on... then your only goal is to warm up...then your only  goal is to start to workout ... and if you feel like, break your last PR because why not. Main point is to break huge problems into very small easily doable tasks and let yourself push through your steps but only 1 task at a time. \n2. You want to study: You already think about those boring pages OMG its like 30 page that I have to learn in one night and what if I can\'t focus and how long will it takes and what if ... blah blah blah. Again... first step: "my only task is to put away my phone and find  the necessary books and put it on the table ... thats it nothing else to worry about...." after you did this ... all right I will just mark the important pages in the book so I will have much easier time when I want to study a bit.... if you are in the mood then you should run through the first subject? You already sit down an you already marked the most important titles and you ran through the first subject so you are well prepared to study a little bit. But only the first subject! Don\'t even think about other subjects until you already know the first subject. Then run through the second one maybe its easier than the previous and so on... \n3. You want to work: Same... instead of thinking about the whole project just write a short outline/draft..it is your only job, maybe do the rest next day who knows don\'t care about this right now... If you finished your outline check the first step and maybe do that. Its like just 5-10 minutes why not... then maybe do the 2nd task and so on.  \n\n\nMain point is go forward in small steps don\'t worry about the unknown future it doesn\'t exist yet. Yes it can be possible that you will feel tired or fustrated during the upcoming workout or work session but maybe it will be one of your best day when you will nail every task. Worry about something that doesn\'t exists yet makes everything harder. **We tend to focus only on the negative side of the things instead counting with the positive possiblities aswell.** Yes maybe you didn\'t break your PR but you got your lazy ass up, went to the gym, dressed up, worked out etc so you already finished 90% of your goals.

The question of whether to use “I” or “me” comes down to whether you are using the word as a subject or as an object in the sentence.\n\n“I” is always used as a subject, while “me” is always used as an object. \n\n• “I went to the store with Robert.”\n\n• “Robert and I went to the store.”\n\nIn both examples “I” is the person who performed the action, which makes “I” the subject of the sentence. \n\n• “Alice gave Ursula and me tickets to the theater.”\n\n• “The vase is a gift from my husband and me.”\n\nIn both examples, “me" is used as an object in the sentence. “Me” is never the subject.\n\n* A QUICK TRICK to figure out if “l” or “me” should be used is to remove the other person from the sentence and see if it still sounds correct.

where dropping to be was perfectly acceptable this leads to forms like as tall as i however this feels strange because now it seems that as must be a preposition governing a noun and english pronouns

constructions like as tall as i am as time passes people get in the habit of dropping that to be since the meaning is still clear this is nothing unusual classical latin has plenty of constructions where dropping to be was perfectly acceptable this leads to forms like as tall as i however this feels strange because now it seems that as must be a preposition governing a noun and english pronouns take the non nominative forms so speakers start using as tall as me this is of course become extremely widespread and is essentially universal now so either as is not a preposition and there s an implicit to be that it s governing or it has become a preposition and should in fact take me etc the only way to really objectively answer this is to see what speech people actually naturally produce

Moreover, subscribers have been expressing their concerns¹ that comics (of both varieties) almost always eclipse every other variety of content offered here.\n\nBasically, on any given day, a poorly made comic featuring a stolen joke has a much better chance of being seen than something well-produced and original. Some of this is the fault of the "Ennui Engine," but it\'s also the result of there being *so many* comics posted in /r/Funny.\n\nTo address this, we\'re going to experiment with a new approach:\n\nGoing forward, comics may only be posted on Wednesdays and Sundays PDT (Pacific Daylight Time), and only by the people creating them.²\n\nOur hopes with this are is twofold: \n\n1. By limiting "comic days" to two days a week, other original content will get the chance that it deserves. \n\n2. Wednesdays and Sundays will come to highlight – with the help of discerning voters, of course – the best comics submitted to the subreddit.³ \n\nThose of you who have had nothing better to do than [read our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/wiki/rules) and stay up to date on all of our announcements will know that we aren\'t *really* changing much, but even so, we wanted to mention the update, explain the reasons behind it, and give folks the chance to discuss⁴ everything.\n\nWe\'ll be trialing this over the next few weeks, and we may end up adjusting things⁵ slightly. \n\nIf you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please feel free to share them here... and thank you, as always, for subscribing to /r/Funny!\n\n------\n\n^(¹ These concerns have ranged from eloquent critiques to "BLARGH BAD COMICS BAD!")\n\n^(² That is to say, comics may only be posted by the people creating the comics. We\'re not sure who creates Wednesdays and Sundays.)\n\n^(³ We thought about "Comic Deathmatch Days" as a label, but we didn\'t want comedians to get startled and start attacking each other.)\n\n^(⁴ No doubt these discussions will be well-informed and well-thought-out, and definitely not text-based screaming matches.)\n\n^(⁵ This turn of phrase wouldn\'t have sounded naughty without this footnote.)'), ('11blzno', 363, 11597, 't5_2qh33', 'funny', 'Mitch Hedberg’s non sequitur one-liners', datetime.datetime(2023, 2, 25, 23, 15, 2), 'https://v.redd.it/dlxsgnu4wdka1', '')]
