Title:[D] What are your long term career goals ? 10+ years

Hello guys, I am trying to figure out long term goals for myself as I feel that I reached some plateau as senior ML engineer. I was wondering what other people in the field long term career goals were ?

Comment body: I came to the US with a future plan of working in cutting-edge ML, but I recently learned how good the money is in simple SWE jobs... I'm honestly torn.

Comment body: ML hasn’t exploded yet, it’s still in infancy. 5 years ago the jobs of data engineer, ml engineer, and data scientists were under the data scientist title. Some companies still do this, but it’s slowly changing. More and more companies will need ML engineers the same way more and more companies started needing developer.

Comment body: I expect the opposite.

As ML matures, it'll be just another standard software tool (like linear regression, or sorting algorithms, or video compression libraries) that every SWE will be expected to be able to use.

I think the video compression analogy is a good one.  Back in the late 1990's many companies (Sony, RealNetworks, C-Cube, etc)  had video compression PhDs tweaking algorithms in the same way we tweak DL models today.  Like ML, video compression involved heavy math and similar tradeoffs of computation-vs-accuracy.    Today, 99.9% of software engineers dealing with video neither know nor care about the math behind H.265.  Sure there a still a couple companies that hire a couple PhDs working on successors to H.266/MPEG-5; and a couple university guys playing with wavelet transforms.

in a couple decades I'm guessing 99% of ML work will just be calling `fit_non_liner_curve(my_data)`, and the libraries themselves will pick a reasonable architecture/model/hyperparameters/etc for the data; in much the same way we call `compress_my_video(frames)` today and it picks reasonable algorithms and default parameters for us.   Sure there'll still be PhDs working with Nvidia on future tweaks to tensor cores; and university PhDs writing papers on slightly differently curved activation functions.   But I think there'll be even fewer of those jobs than there are today.

Comment body: Video compression has a well defined single goal, keep quality high while reducing data transfer. The idea that you can have a one-size fits all algo for ML stuff is almost laughable. Probably things like object detection will be commoditized, there I agree with you, but we have barely begun to scratch the surface for how to apply these new ML techniques to almost any field.

A lot of it can be reduced to "fit these data points to these non-linear curves efficiently".

Sure, there are some optimizations for differently shaped inputs --- pictures are rectangles of small numbers; paragraphs are long lines of bigger integers --- but as good-enough optimizations for each are found and hardware gets faster, even those differences won't matter as much.
