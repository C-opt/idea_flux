Title:This insane job application I gave up on last night blew my mind.

I posted the majority of this as a comment in response to another post, in another sub, and then decided it needs its own post as well. This experience was incredible, to me. 

I was applying to a *part time* remote chat gig that pays $*11.50*/hour just last night, to do in addition to my full time remote job for some extra money.

Every time I thought I’d completed the app, more steps arose. They had little green check marks on each section completed, with like three sections at a time, and then BOOM, a new task list populated. 

Before I quit the app, I made it far enough to complete 

- five fill in the blank style questions that required paragraphs-long responses to how you’d handle work situations 

- 10 questions that required you search their mock-database to appropriately select pre-scripted answers to simulated customer emails/chats/complaints 

- a portion where you explained via email that an “order had been delayed due to a severe blizzard on the east coast” and that the customer “could call the phone support line between 8a-8p M-F for more information” in TWO ways (a “causal, friendly” answer and a “formal, more professional” answer)

- an incredibly long typing test that required you get 100% accuracy and at least 70WPM (that had unlimited attempts)

- a portion involving describing your relevant experience (in response to three questions about said experience) in three separate blank sections (“what skills do you have that make you a good fit?“; “what motivates you to do a good job?”; “what experience do you have that makes you well suited for this role?”)

- AND a question asking “how you display empathy to customers” that you *had* to record and upload a voice response (using a provided website service) that was 60-90 seconds long for, with a note that you’d be judged on articulation, vocabulary, grammar, tone of voice and the answer itself (for a 100% chat role)

*AFTER ALL OF THAT*, which took me about 40 minutes, I was brought to the first of FIVE long sections of a multiple choice assessment. I stopped, at that point. No clue what would have come next. 

All of that for $11.50/hour part time work, no benefits (due to being part time), AND having to use your own equipment (computer etc.) was absolutely insane, to me. 

I wonder if anyone will even make it through that process. 

I genuinely don’t know where these companies get off thinking that this bologna is acceptable for such low pay and a complete lack of any perks at all.

I can’t even find the website, now, but believe the company was called “wrrk” or something. I’ll attempt to find the job posting on Indeed, should anyone be interested. Lastly, I’ve gotten several emails saying that my application isn’t complete and I can finish it at any time, so I tried to respond to one explaining why I am not interested and how ridiculous their process is, but it was bounced back as undeliverable. The email doesn’t even list the name of the company in it (nor does the email address).

Comment body: The worst thing is when you do all of that and get an automated rejection within 24 hours. I just got a “thanks so much for interviewing with us we really enjoyed meeting you but we are going with someone else” email except I never even interviewed with them. The whole system is broken.

Comment body: I actually got an interview for a position, then got two emails a few days later at the same time. The first was a "You were a good match for the position, but we've decided to go with another applicant" and the second was from a jobs website letting me know the position was just relisted as available by the company. It was a unique enough position and one that only one person would ever be needed for, so it was definitely the same job listing.
