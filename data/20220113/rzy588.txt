Title:[D] Does anyone else think open source code/examples in machine learning domain usually are not as readable as they could be? Specifically use of magic numbers.
URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/rzy588/d_does_anyone_else_think_open_source_codeexamples/
Admittedly, I am not an expert in machine learning or different libraries but the code I see as an example is not really beginner friendly. Even for an expert, I am not sure, they know all libraries and quircks of different datasets.

Let me elaborate. The main problem I see is the use of magic numbers. For example, in below hypothetical code

    x = dataset[1]


there is no indication of why 1 is used instead of 0 or what does it mean. May be 0th elemnt contains metadata/some useless data. Or in other cases, some axis is chosen without specifying why that is used and what are other axis to put in context.

My only suggestion would be to not ever use a magic number unless it is immediately obvious. Can we not use an appropriately named constant in that case?

    MY_DATA_INDEX=1
    x = dataset[MY_DATA_INDEX]

I believe this is a very simple and helpful convention to follow. If such conventions are already there, can someone point me to then? May be people aren't just using them too often.

Comment body: Most of the SOTA ML repos on github is research code for a paper, it is not supposed to be readable it is supposed to be quick and dirty proof of concept type...

Comment body: What's the point of research papers if not to communicate ideas?

If your code is part of that communication (it is), then shouldn't it also be optimized for communication?

I mean, it sounds tautological, but this strikes me as common sense.

Comment body: Nope the idea and implementation details is in the research paper, code is more similar to the 'experimental setup' in physical sciences... as similar to other fields you don't need to sent your experimental setup with the paper to the publisher, similarly putting accompanying code is not required in ML (most of the journals) and most of the papers don't have code up on a repo or it becomes available sometime afterwards... 

Also most of the ML researchers are not 'programmers' by trade and most are not even computer science engineers, hence it is highly stupid to expect production-level code from them... the improvement OP suggests is kinda stupid as the code is put to show the algo works and not meant to make it easily transferable...

Then those fields are engaged in suboptimal communication, and therefore suboptimal research, as well.

&#x200B;

Again, *what is the point* of research papers if not to communicate ideas?

Are those ideas not communicated in Python as well as English?

Do you value good writing in English? I do.

Then why wouldn't you value good writing in Python?

Don't you think it is arrogant to call every other field except computer science/ML to have *suboptimal communication and sub-optimal research...*

Expecting non-programmers to write production-level code even when it is not at all required is kinda gatekeeping...

Also if you know there are many groundbreaking studies/research in languages other than English...

>Do you value good writing in English? I do.

LOL and do you think the majority of papers in academia(STEM) are well written?

Comment body: CS/ML also has suboptimal communication and research. That's the whole point of this thread.

Not once did I advocate for researchers writing production code. Do you know what that term means?

The point isn't the specific language or computer language. The point is that good communication is necessary in both.

I also never said the majority of papers in STEM are well written. I said I value good writing. Those are different claims.

&#x200B;

Please stop putting words in my mouth, and please think before you write. Also, this is the second time you've evaded my fundamental question. ***What is the point of research papers if not to communicate ideas?*** And if that is the point, why do you think that poor communication is justified?

Comment body: Again code is not a research paper it is an "experimental setup" and proof of concept that the algorithm mentioned in the paper works, the only thing it is expected to do is work and produce exact results as mentioned in the paper, the code has no value without the paper whereas the paper has value without the code repository... you are expected to read the paper and not the code...

Comment body: You just keep failing to answer the main question.

The code is obviously part of the research. The code is *communicated* to the reader and is therefore part of the *communication*.

Anyone who wants to understand a piece of research in-depth will absolutely read the code.

This is really not that hard.

Comment body: You are failing to understand what is an experimental setup and actual research communication ... I think you are either a high school or just started college, I would suggest you spend a bit more time in academia...
