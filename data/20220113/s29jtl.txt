Title:9-5 is killing my soul. How am I supposed to rationalize having my whole life essentially dedicated to work?

It’s getting harder and harder to put in my 8 hours daily. My job is also super demanding. I hate that all I do is work, think about work or recover from work. Wfh as a young person also makes me feel incredibly isolated and lonely, and my job even more depressing.  

I feel like stating advice like “pick up a hobby” is just a coping mechanism for making this dreadful existence just a bit more tolerable. I feel like I need to fix the root cause but I’m not sure what that is. In my head, it’s creating my own startup but that seems like an unrealistic dream. 

What do I do?

Edit: to be clear, I mean dedicated to work I do not enjoy and that I find completely meaningless. I’m not complaining about having to do work in general. I like having goals and striving towards things. I don’t think I will ever feel fulfilled in the corporate world. My sacrifice ultimately disproportionately benefiting and making the company ceo and his friends richer and richer while I’m giving up my life for their benefit.

Comment body: In addition to other suggestions, here is some stuff I personally recommend:

-	get a position where you can work from home full time (you already have this it seems)
-	make sure the culture is healthy enough where you can pop out to run an errand or two without anyone caring
-	use your lunch breaks to exercise or do house work 
-	take frequent breaks away from screens
-	if you are feeling lonely, join a coworking space (I have made very close friends this way)
-	create boundaries. When you close your laptop stop thinking about work until you open it again

Comment body: It's basically a shared office full of people who work at different companies. If you go to a good one they have social events and people who will shoot the breeze in the lunch room, stuff like that. 

One I went to, we had a shared slack channel and after work we'd go out and grab beer, and none of us worked at the same company.
