Title:Decent jobs for people with low IQ?
URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/s2igsv/decent_jobs_for_people_with_low_iq/
I took an IQ test in high school and I scored around 80, which is below average. I struggle in retail and fast food jobs. Anything that's fast paced, I keep underperforming at. I took an office internship one time. I tried to do my best but I kept making mistakes and forgetting what to do. I was asking the same question again about separating files of paper from one another and my boss got mad. Later on, I quit because I felt useless. I have been at my current job, which is retail for one whole year and I am still underperforming. It takes me a longer time to grasp certain things on the job. I learn slower than my peers. I am studying business in college right now. My city is expensive and I need to survive. I am scared because I don't how I will survive in this world. I perform way too slow compared to my other coworkers, which sucks. I take too long to get my tasks and things completed. Looking for another job now is very hard and I don't know what to do.

Comment body: Check out something which has a very strong routine, working in a production line for example. You might find that you thrive in a situation that has repetitive tasks. 


What skills do you have? (focus on these!) if you drive you could work in haulage or deliveries. 

Do you have any hobbies? For example if you like to work out maybe work at a gym.
