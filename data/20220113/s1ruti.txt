Title:Actual options for a felon who quit school at 16?
URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/s1ruti/actual_options_for_a_felon_who_quit_school_at_16/
I have a non lucrative small business out of my home and need a steady job to support my son. I have a felony aggravated assault conviction and I quit school the day after my 16th birthday. I never got my GED or anything. It doesn't have to be incredible work or fulfilling work. Just something steady. I live in Anchorage, Alaska.
