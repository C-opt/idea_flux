Title:It really is wonderful that virtual interviews are now so common because it is that much easier to quickly shut down horrific pay offers and cut line from terrible interviews and interviewers.

Just finished an awful Zoom interview for a position in a graduate degree level field where the pay for the certifications in my area of expertise and geographic area is at least in the mid 70k range.  This is with no benefits or paid time off and thankfully I have an amazing partner with a good job and good benefits.


I've had interviews with a few places and they have been great for the most part.  The interview today was atrocious.  The interviewer looked like they wanted to be any place but there, however we talked for about 40 minutes and I answered all their questions.  The interviewer did appreciate my responses and specifically said I matched many of the qualifications they were looking for.


That was when they let me know the contracting rate and I asked them to give me a minute while I fully calculated this to confirm the yearly amount.  It totaled 39k a year, NO BENEFITS, and they started going on about some other stuff when I interrupted them and let them know "This is for 39k a year? Is that the max you will pay?"  


They then said yes and I told them that was unacceptable.  They said "Well I'm glad you cut me off mid conversation then to not waste time" and I told them I hate interrupting people and that this pay amount was incredibly low.  I thanked them and when they were in mid-sentence I ended the Zoom session immediately.  AND IT FELT GREAT.  It felt great to tell them how disrespectful their bullshit offer was and not have to take any more time out of my day to drive back anywhere.
