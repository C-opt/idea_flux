Title:What's the typical salary raise for an engineer?
URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/s17hzu/whats_the_typical_salary_raise_for_an_engineer/
I work as a flight test engineer and got a 2% raise, this seems really low. How low is this raise percentage?

Edit: I'm curious to see what the raise is at other aerospace companies like Lockheed, Boeing, Raytheon etc if anyone from there sees this post

Edit 2: just to clarify since some of you think my raise is tied to my poor performance, that's not the case. My boss couldn't get me the raise he wanted. No more funding he said.

Comment body: you are talking about two different things.

the 2%-3% yearly increase is not a raise, it is a inflation/adquisitive-power adjustment to your salary.

2% is on the low end of the reasonable values for salary adjustment.

Comment body: Excellent performance and retention. It’s not that I was paid under market necessarily, but they want me to stick around. I also make it a point to discuss raises/salaries in general with my manager every 6 months. We have so much red tape to get through it can take 2-3 months for a raise to go through.

Comment body: kinda nuts that 10% real wage growth for "excellent performance" is acceptable in the engineering industry.

Comment body: lol at my company you get 2% if you’re an excellent performer.  So only the best just to offset 33-50% of inflation.

Comment body: 2% is super low. Just to be clear, I’m not bragging here, I still think my raises are abysmal. But 2% is “I should be actively searching for a different job” levels of bad. 

Also, 33-50% of inflation? What?

Comment body: I think he’s saying that if inflation is ~6% then a 2% raise is only 33-50% of that 6% inflation.
