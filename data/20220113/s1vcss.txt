Title says it all. 
I’m waiting on the word from a new role and if I get it I want to hand in my resignation the same day to minimise my time spent here.

I’ve been here 9 months and would hope to never use this place as a referee so can I be honest? 

Everyone is concerned about burning bridges but I feel like that is to keep some positive leverage in the relationship

Edit: I didn't mean walking out on the same day, I have a notice period I will stick to. I just want to know whether there is any real downside to telling them how bad my experience has been.

Comment body: Don't tell them about how upset you are; your problems are not their problems and I guarantee that they won't care. Once you get that new job, put in your notice, do the bare minimum, and cash those checks. Leave the emotions at the door - it's just business.

Comment body: Still, don’t. If you’re leaving they will not care about your opinions in the slightest. No need to help them fix things when you’re on the way out, it’s not your problem.
