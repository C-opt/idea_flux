I basically sent a message saying "i got a small heater ive been using on and off, if you feel it or it gets warm please let me know!" I thought it was the considerate thing to do, but my mom told me im gonna look like an idiot?

Comment body: It was a very considerate thing to do. But make sure you clear it with your office manager. I worked at an office that banned personal space heaters after an accidental fire the year before I started.

Also, being kind and considerate never makes one look like an idiot. Continue being a good person with a kind character, please. I would have appreciated the message.

Comment body: You were considerate, especially since some people are sensitive to temperature changes. It was the right thing to do in a shared space. Also always make sure to plug it directly into the outlet, not an extension cord or power strip!
