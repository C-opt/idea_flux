Title:Rejected after 7 rounds. Feeling depressed.

I was really wishing to get this job because I'm tired of grinding leetcode everyday (5 a day). The pay would have changed my life and ny families life. I wish I did internships. I'm a senior and am graduating soon.

Edit: I used the wrong vocabulary here. By rounds I mean "rounds of interviews", not rounds as in "days".  I had 7 interviews,  4 rounds. The second day and fhe final day had multiple interviews.

Did not expect this many replies so thanks everyone. I made this post when I was very upset, but everything is fine now. I took the day to just chill out and I already feel like bouncing back. I'm sure everyone has had this happen at least once. I'm gonna turn off inbox replies now.

Comment body: Just hang in there and keep applying. It's hard getting that first offer. But 7 rounds is crazy. I didn't realize some companies had that many rounds.

Comment body: It's 7 rounds. Google has 6 rounds technically, 1 phone call and then 5  during onsite.  


Still 2 system design for a junior is a meaningless waste of time for everyone

Comment body: Eh, Palantir is a *lot* worse than even like, Facebook.

Facebook is contributing to the decline of things like Democracy. Palantir not only thinks that's an awesome idea, they're building the tools that tyrants use to persecute their constituents.

Comment body: I completely disagree, Facebook and it’s ability to create echo-chambers, it’s mass adoption, and it’s affect it has on younger generations is much more problematic long-term. Also, you’re scared of Palantir more, which means Facebook is doing its job well. Clear winner there
