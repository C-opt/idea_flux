Comment body: Resigned November 1st. The company pulled a bait and switch regarding their extreme micromanagement culture and terrible work/life balance. I figured I'd stick it out for at least 6 months while looking elsewhere. 

I didn't last two months. I'm a salaried financial controller working remotely and was subject to strict, invasive time and activity monitoring. I couldn't so much as take a shit, make a pot of coffee or fold laundry without being questioned by HR about 6-10 minutes of "idle time" like a fucking child because the software recorded if your mouse or keyboard didn't move after 5 minutes, and continuously took screenshots every 9 minutes. I was shackled to my desk 9-10 hours a day, while doing the work of 3 people, and not a single recruiting effort was made to replace my staff who left shortly before I started. I said this is literally not what I signed up for and gave them 4 days notice.

I'm 37 with no contract on my lease. I packed my whole house into storage and I moved in with my parents. (OP said no shame haha). Very humbling but it gave me the opportunity to not be reactive in my job search out of financial desperation.

After hundreds of rejections, several self-declined opportunities, and a couple dozen interviews,  I just signed an offer letter yesterday making 15% more with incredible benefits with a company that's exactly what I'm looking for. I start on Tuesday!

*PSA: Work sucks and theres inherent stress, but NO job is worth compromising your mental health or wellbeing.*

Comment body: I am so sorry - that sucks! 

I thought the micromanaging I experienced was bad (My boss asked me for hour-by-hour breakdowns of each day the last month I worked there) but holy shit - your place took it to a new level

Comment body: Thanks. It was unreal.

I also had to email an EOD time stamped breakout of everything I did, along with a separate email with the same time stamped format, of how I expected to spend the next day. So when you're done for the day, you had to put aside 20-30 more minutes for bullshit. 

Emails had to be formatted *just so* or the C suite would kick them back for me to rephrase it, "the company way."

I'm too far along in my career for such nonsense.

There's ALOT more to unpack. I'm probably going to post it on r/antiwork soon....

So much this. My boss would whine ENDLESSLY when I put an hour a day of just "Misc Admin" and I was like "Well you keep interrupting my day with requests for check ins or making me schedule meetings for you..."

Worth noting - I was not their assistant. They were just "too busy to manage [their] calendar"

Comment body: Bruh you have no idea. They would frequently triple book themselves (and us), misgender clients, and mess up peoples' names (on Zoom, where there are name tags) and forget things they said in meetings because they were "hustling too fast"

Here's my favorite - we were talking about how to analyze some data for a climate assessment, and they went off on a tear about how I should incorporated this theme and that idea into my analysis. I tuned them out because sometimes this person would just throw out some big idea and then decide it was the wrong direction to go in.

So they were like "So you're going to do that, right?" And I said "I'm sorry, I got a little lost there. Do you mind summing up what you want in an email and I'll see what I can do?"

Their response? "No. Because by the time I get around to writing that email, I won't remember what I asked you to do."

It took every fiber of my being to not reply, "Then it must not be that important, huh?"
