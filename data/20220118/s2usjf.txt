Title:My offer got rescinded after I asked if I can stay remote

I got an offer recently from a mid-sized company that advertised a remote position. After I received the offer, I was told it was "company policy" to go back into the office once everything re-opens. I live 5 hours away from the HQ. I told HR that this would be a big decision for me, and that I would have to either leave my family or make them all move out with me, and then asked if there was any possibility that I could stay remote after re-opening. Didn't get any response after that email. Instead, I got an automated email that said that my offer was voided. Seriously? Fuck HR. It's so depressing. I was actually excited to join the company too.

Edit: I'm not planning on reviewing in Glassdoor or naming and shaming because it's too recent and I don't wanna risk getting doxxed at the moment. I'm sorry if I sound paranoid, but I wanna play it safe and give them the review in a few months from now.

Comment body: They were never planning to be remote in the first place and just force their decision when people no longer have the choice.
Such when they’ve already resigned from their other job.

Shitty company.

Comment body: That’s why you have everyone in debt. Mortgages, student loan, car finance, buy now pay later.

You do not want to play by the rules? You lose the house, your wife will despise you and get a divorce.
Your neighbour will look down on you.

It’s a clever system of oppression with a carefully knitted narative.

Id you have to work 40h weeks and do not have the freedom of place and time, you are mostly a slave.

Aa, and health insurance, encouraging employers to provide it, that is clever as well.

Comment body: Health insurance is such an insanely stifling system.  It makes it so much scarier to try to be an entrepreneur here.

Comment body: At least healthcare dot gov exists. You can buy your own benefits. Not that they’re necessarily cheap. But, in many states, when you apply, you’ll be offered some type of assistance…food stamps even. Also, many medications can be procured on a budget without insurance thru GoodRX.

Comment body: It just acts as a substitute for medication insurance. It’s largely free. You just go to their page & search for your medication. It tells you which places near you accept Good RX, and what the prices are for you. And it’s most always surprisingly reasonable. I attached a link for [Lipitor](https://m.goodrx.com/lipitor) as an example

Comment body: I would like to point out for goodrx that they make money by clawbacks from the pharmacy so any time it's used the pharmacy will lose money.

I'm not saying don't use it, but please try to avoid using it at independent pharmacies and instead just ask if they can work with you on price. Use it all you want with the big chains though, screw them.
