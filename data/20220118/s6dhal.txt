Hi! I am 51, work a job in bookkeeping that I hate. This place is beyond toxic! People drinking on the job, including the boss, the boss and his step son argue violently at least once a month etc. I started working here in 2020 after being laid off of my previous job and then fired due to staff cuts. I lost my dog of 13 years in April of 2020 and went 2 months before adopting another dog. I live on 4 acres with my boyfriend and his family, and dad will not allow us to put up a fence for the dog. When we brought him home, my boss at my new job said I could bring him to work with me, since we had no fences, and my in laws are in their 80s. So, he started coming to work to with me, and as a result, has not been left home with the old folks who are not physically capable of walking him etc. Here we are 2 years late and I feel so depressed coming to this hell hole every day that I made an appointment to talk to a counselor! I want to look for another job and I know I can find something else but feel stuck because of the dog. And no, giving him up is not an option. Anyone have any suggestions?

Comment body: Have you considered doggy daycare? Or crate-training so that he can stay at home safely? 

edit to add that we alternate between both things I suggested for our dog when we work/leave the house

Comment body: He cries for as long as you put him in a crate..hours if you leave him that long. We tried that but the rescue told us they had an issue there as well. Most likely someone misused the crate in his past because it is traumatic for him. I have looked at doggy day care put every day I can not afford. How often do you send yours? I am also now looking into dog walkers possibly coming a few times a week since someone mentioned that as well. Thank you!

Comment body: If you'd like to attempt to re-train him in the crate, I'd suggest putting his favourite blanket, toy, and a shirt of yours that smells like you in there. If he has a dog bed, take it away for a bit. Don't shut him in the crate, but let him explore it on his own once those items are in there, try feeding him there as well so he can associate crate = good things/safe place. Eventually you might start to see him go in the crate on his own during the day to nap, or take his toys in there. That's how we trained our dog and that's what he does now. He also will only sleep in his crate at night, we don't make him. But he did used to hate it as a puppy, the training had to be consistent. 
I currently wfh, so we only send him to daycare 1-2 times a week. When we both go back to working away from home, we will alternate between daycare (it is quite expensive for 5x a week) and having a walker come by.

Comment body: How much are you spending on daycare? It is $45 per day here. Yikes! Dog walkers are $20 per half hour..maybe at those rates, I should open my own service!

Comment body: It is the exact same pricing for me as well. But we also have sent our dog 6am-5pm so it is reasonable. Boarding kennels can be cheaper but then you're just paying for your dog to be in a room elsewhere, vs at daycare at least they get their energy out. 
When it comes to your actual career though, dog-walking is certainly an option, even part-time, if you feel it is something you'd want to do. Our dog-walker does walks + daycare as his full-time job.

Comment body: Ahh.. I literally know nothing about it..never had to use it before. You can leave the dog all day for the same price? I like the idea of him having friends to play with. He LOVES other dogs! As for it becoming a career? I hadn't thought of it but I would be great! Wouldn't know where to start but that may be a viable option. THANK YOU!!! <3
