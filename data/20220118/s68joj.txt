Title:Don't know why I bother to keep applying. I have 35 years exp in my field and I'm 59. Have applied for hundreds of jobs and if I get an interview they see the gray hair and it's done. Even if I just put down my experience for this century it's still too much. Feh.

FYI: Was a journalist for 25 years, corporate writing for the past 14 -- mar com, content management, white papers, B2B. Lots of experience in infosec, finance, marketing.

Also, appreciate the suggestions about starting my own company and I've been freelancing for past 14 years and it isn't working for me anymore.

Really appreciate all the comments and suggestions.

Comment body: I feel for you my friend. I'm the same age, same amount of experience in my career path and often, I'll get positive comments on the fact that in the past 22 years, I've only been with two companies. Then the first in-person or video interview..."I'm sorry, we decided to go with another candidate"

Comment body: I've hired a few people who've spent 15+ years at their previous employer - all of them have been really difficult to onboard because they have virtually no experience of 'starting a new job'.

Comment body: I'm going to politely disagree from my point of view. My current employer has a shitshow of an on boarding programme. It basically didn't exist

Comment body: I've worked for multiple companies and the onboarding has mostly been shit, to be honest. If you have got a good one, good for you, but I don't think many people have had a good experience with it. I certainly haven't

Comment body: I’ve seen 3 different spots where he blamed applicants with almost 20 years experience in the same field as “untrainable” 

I’m gonna bet it’s they way they’re training, as those folks have successfully worked in that field for 20 years.

Comment body: It’s the same thread?  I didn’t say people were u trainable , just that my experience of a few candidates who had many years at the same pleaded was that they couldn’t manage onboarding well.
