Title:Depressed Engineer Job Search Rant
URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/s4xb57/depressed_engineer_job_search_rant/
For context I  graduated 8 months ago with an engineering degree, tons of project experience including NASA, my internship was cancelled due to COIVD and I haven't been able to land a full time job since then. 

* I applied **+300** positions each with **tailored resume** and **cover letter** 
* I posses in-demand skills (Proficient with CAD, CFD, Python, Matlab, FEA, and other analysis tools) with a **3.24** GPA  
* I reached out to at least **3** people in the company I am interested in on LinkedIn to introduce myself and establish communication (That's more than **900** people I've contacted)
* I have done a couple of online courses and certifications to boost my skills even more 
* I have casted a huge net for my job application, my criteria is literally a **related engineering job** that pays a **living wage** and is located **anywhere in the US.** 
* I have reached out to old professors, colleagues, mentor, classmates, and anyone who might know anyone who might help in addition to the career center of my school and the alumni network. 
* I have done countless interviews and reached the final round (usually **4th**) **5 times** before being rejected because **they are looking for someone with more experience for an entry level job** 
* I have considered applying for internships but almost all of them require **being enrolled in school**
* I am even working with a recruiter who will take **%5** of my first year salary just in hope of getting an offer. 

I am not trying to be picky about my job but I am super depressed from getting rejection after rejection for the past 8 months. I can't stand companies who advertise an entry level position and require candidates to have full-time job experiences. I keep hearing the job market is hot right now and companies are hiring like crazy which doesn't seem to be right. 

I have been unemployed for the past 8 months and my engineering degree is useless, my savings are almost gone while companies reject me because they are looking for a **+5 years experienced superstar for an entry level role and pay.** 

Thank you for listening to my rant, and hopefully your day is going better than mine

Comment body: I’m going to say something that makes me very unhappy. You are being forced to look at contract jobs to gain experience. 

Contracts are how many of us got our first job/jobs to gain experience. They suck, you get shit for benefits, you work stupid hours for a company that will treat you like a temp.  But once you have one of those jobs, maybe for a year, companies will start looking seriously at you because you’ve proven that you can play nice and manage your time. 

Post your resume on sites like career builder, monster, etc. the recruiters will start to spam call you (some started within an hour of me posting last time)

It isn’t desirable, but it is work and you will be gaining experience rather than racking up more moths of being unemployed.

Comment body: This is the way. I had no engineering experience. And recently I was hired full time to a high paying position after 6 months into a 9 month contract position.

Only thing I'd add to your post for OP is that. If you can. Sign a contract with a big fortune 500 company like I did. Excel in the position and overachieve. Working long hours if need be. And they'll probably hire you. If not. When you apply for your next job. Don't put your contract company on your resume but put down the company your contract company hired you to work for.

Also, I'll say what I wished someone else told me when I was job hunting. 

Unlike most things. You don't know how far or how close you are. 

They'll be jobs you think you are a sure thing for. And you won't get it. 

And the day before you get the "you're hired" call. You'll have no idea. 

Just keep your head up and keep grinding. The only way you fail is if you stop trying.

Comment body: If you’re including your GPA, which is low for an engineer, on your resume, you’re already disqualifying yourself fyi

Comment body: 3.24 isnt low for an engineer??? Maybe for certain schools but at mine it was a miracle if you got out over 3.0 at all!

Comment body: Most automatic sorters filter out anything below a 3.5. I hear you, I agree, but hiring managers aren’t engineers and they don’t know that. Below 3.5 don’t include a gpa

Comment body: Damnit my career services mentor said that since my GPA was a 3.0 or above (I had a 3.01) that I should include it on my resume. I'm gonna get rid of that and see how much that changes things. 

This is depressing as fuck...
