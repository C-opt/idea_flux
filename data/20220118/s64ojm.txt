Title:Leaving medicine for software
URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/s64ojm/leaving_medicine_for_software/
Hello all, 25 years old med stud here(just 5.5 months left). I am having doubts about my career choice(turns out i do not like the hospital environment, long shifts etc.). 

Is it possible that i can get a job in software development with a medical degree? Does anybody in here have a similar experience?
 

EDIT:
 First and foremost, I'd like to express my gratitude to everyone for their contributions. I am leaning towards to software because I enjoy math and have competed in math olympics.

Fortunately, I am studying medicine on a full scholarship, therefore I am currently debt-free. I plan to finish school and then consider my options.

Comment body: You probably spent a lot of money and time for why you’ve done in med school. What makes you think you will like software more?

Comment body: Medicine is a lot of ~~w~~rote memorization. Software engineering is a lot of problem solving. It’s two different types of difficulties, IMO, ~~w~~rote memorization is easier.

The hard part about medicine is going through med school and residency, but this person is nearly done with med school.

Comment body: I know this is a CS sub but this is just ridiculous. Medicine is filled with problem solving, and 80% of software engineers are just CRUDing day-in day-out.

Comment body: 90% of doctors are just following a standard written procedure day in and day out. My days are filled with bug fixes which there is no procedure for.

Like unless the doctor is dealing with a novel case, they’re just prescribing the standard medicine, evaluating with the normal methods. Asking for normal tests and procedures and looking at the numbers that came back and comparing those to expected value. There’s very little problem solving.

Comment body: So if they are requesting tests and procedures in order to make a diagnosis, it sounds a bit like…. problem solving. And not every doc is a general practitioner. Anesthesiologists are constantly juggling chemicals so that you don’t die or wake up. Surgeons make mistakes and have to make high pressure hard decisions. Some are much more about human problem solving - an end of life doctor needs to solve the very hard moral problem of how to minimize the misery of the patient and their family.

Comment body: Asking for tests isn’t problem solving, that’s getting analytics. Comparing those values to expected values isn’t, that’s pattern matching.

I was a philosophy major, and even I couldn’t make the decisions of morality the doctors do; they just pretend like they know the right choice, with much less understanding of morality. The decision is for the patient to make, doctors are just arrogant. Stop idolizing doctors.

Comment body: Well that was my second major. CS and philosophy have a lot in common. Not sure you’d be good at it though

Comment body: Well you seem to have this idea that doctors know everything about morality, without significant studying of it, and didn’t question that idea, which is pretty naive..

Just something a bit too ignorant for philosophy

Comment body: But /u/ClittoryHinton only said physicians have a hard moral problem to solve, not that they know everything there is to know about morality. Are you being disingenuous on purpose?
