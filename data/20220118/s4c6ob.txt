Title:[P] Built a dog poop detector for my backyard

Over winter break I started poking around online for ways to track dog poop in my backyard. I don't like having to walk around and hope I picked up all of it. Where I live it snows a lot, and poops get lost in the snow come new snowfall. I found some cool concept gadgets that people have made, but nothing that worked with just a security cam. So I built this poop detector and made a video about it. When some code I wrote detects my dog pooping it will remember the location and draw a circle where my dog pooped on a picture of my backyard.

So over the course of a couple of months I have a bunch of circle on a picture of my backyard, where all my dog's poops are. So this coming spring I will know where to look!

Check out the video if you care: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWZu3rnj-kQ

Figured I would share here, it was fun to work on. Is this something you would hook up to a security camera if it was simple? Curious.

Also, check out DeepLabCut. My project wouldn't have been possible without it, and it's really cool: https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut

Comment body: Did you use machine learning to detect the structure and anatomy of the dog or how does it know which end the poop came out of ? I presume you need accuracy down to a half foot ?

Comment body: Hey, yeah all the heavy lifting was done by DeepLabCut. That software is awesome. Trained a model on some images I captured and labeled, then my code basically just analyzes the spine & tail points over time. e.g. if the tail is about 180 degrees for 3 seconds straight, it's more likely that the dog is pooping.

So DeepLabCut gets me the points in 2D space. Then I have my poop detection heuristics running 30fps as images stream into my PC. DeepLabCut needs more attention, it's awesome

Comment body: This is an undeniably creative application, and it sounds like you did a really great job implementing it! One question I have is:  


>Then I have my poop detection heuristics running 30fps as images stream into my PC. 

Is this running 24/7? What the energy costs for this project? And what sort of environmental impact does it bring with it?

Comment body: Currently I have my security camera ftp recordings over to an ftp server I have running whenever motion is detected. Then when my pc is on it will process what's in the ftp server to detect any recent poops .. otherwise I usually just leave it on during the day, and it processes real time.

This is something I mention in the video.. I'd like to decouple my hardware from the capability..have the compute run in AWS or something
