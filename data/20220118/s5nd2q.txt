We’ve never had so many CS grads each year, that are all fighting for a comparatively low number of junior friendly positions. 

After how many years do you get out of that fresh new grad category? 3 yoe?

Comment body: It’s certainly been worse. After the dot com bubble, many companies stopped hiring new grads entirely. Other former interns had their full time offers rescinded. 

New grads and interns are usually the first group to pull back on hiring when things get bad. It puts a lot of demand on more experienced engineers to train and manage them. If your company isn’t growing, it doesn’t make sense to hire them.

Isn’t this the case currently? Not all companies but many?

Comment body: That hasn’t been my impression. It is hard to get new engineers ramped up in wfh. But I think there’s also just a lot of competition for positions. There are clear counterfactuals to this like Netflix starting to hire new grads for the first time too that shows some of the desperation to hire companies are feeling.

Also don’t confuse seasonal hiring patterns for pulling back on hiring. Hiring good new grads is very competitive. Many fill all their positions by fall for the next summer.

Comment body: My area stopped hiring new grads during covid. My university had a career fair last spring and all 12 of the companies that showed up said they were not currently hiring during covid.

Comment body: Exactly my thought! It was such a waste of time. I think they wanted to keep up their relationship with the professor/university, maybe?

Comment body: It's cheap marketing and brand recognition. They get to advertise working in their company in person, to a very targeted audience. Even if they are not hiring now, the brand recognition may help them hire you in 2 or 5 years.

Comment body: You don't have to go. No one's forcing you to. Regardless, if you won't work at a company because they merely went to the the conference to tell students about their company, product and answer questions then you have weird priorities.

Comment body: But why waste someone’s time that’s looking for a job? Just seems like a dick move to do that to someone trying to find a job so you can get “brand recognition” lol

Comment body: Have you ever been to a career fair? Its not that quick for one, also if you went to one with 12 companies and every single one wasn’t hiring you probably would’ve wasted an hour or two, possibly missed class and in my case I had to borrow professional clothes from friends / friend’s dads since I couldn’t afford them. So yeah, I’d be pretty pissed that I’m out here looking for a job so I can pay my bills while 12 assholes jerk themselves off in a room
