Title:Companies are starting to ask LC hards for entry level.. is it due to saturation? What will the future look like in your opinion?

I remember when most companies would ask leetcode easy, and it was enough to filter people out and find candidates.

Now it seems like more and more companies have moved on, even from asking mediums, to asking straight up LC hards in a 45 minute interview.. hell, sometimes even in an initial phone screen.

I guess it kind of makes sense. The enrolment in CS programs has skyrocketed, people are applying to companies in massive amounts.. we also have bootcamp grads, self taught developers, etc. And I think corona has really shined a light on this field as one of the few industries that actually thrived during the pandemic.

Where do you guys see the future of interviews heading? Will leetcode not be enough soon? Will they need to resort to other tactics?

Comment body: Does experience level even matter here?  I'm not sure Senior devs are necessarily better at LC, its just a practiced skill you gotta learn before interviewing.

I'd argue worse.  

At least in my case.

Comment body: They are only worse if they dont practice prior to interviews.  You can't just program for 10 years daily then expect to solve leetcodes easily.

Comment body: Isn't that proof that leetcode has no bearing on the ability to get the job done?

Comment body: I mean.. someone who can crank out leetcode hards with optimal solutions without breaking a sweat probably can code. It's just not a great way to measure to the job requirements, unless the candidate is to crank out nothing but algorithms at work.

Comment body: My coworker is an SDEII master in leetcode. We regret hiring him. His code is a damn mess. Broke prod a few times in the beginning, now we review his PRs with a very critical eye and tell him to redo/refactor more often than not. But he can split a BST, search a rotated sorted array and count the number of Islands, so that's cool.

Comment body: Interesting. I wonder how or why that happens. I mean, some of these are actually pretty challenging to solve, so it's a curiosity why the problem solving and logic building skills don't translate well into work.
