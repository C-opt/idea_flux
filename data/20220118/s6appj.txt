I have never had a job and I live with my parents. I am 30 years old. A failure. What can I do to get myself into position to eventually earn $50k+? People recommend fast food but that pays $8 per hour with no "hard" skills given. Should I learn to code?

Comment body: You can’t be a failure because it sounds like you never even tried. What have you been doing all this time?

Comment body: I have been watching anime and using reddit pretty much for the last 6 years. Also recovering from my nervous breakdown. I sleep between 12 hours and 18 hours per day.

Comment body: **A nervous breakdown is no joke.**  People don't understand - it's mental AND physical.  Your day-to-day stability is wrecked.  I had one five years back and was "out of order" for 5 full months.  Started at the bottom working again, part-time, whatever.  I'm still not back in balance like I was - permanently damaged.  But I can work to some degree - I've held a few jobs for months, and over a year.  The high-anxiety issue has wrecked me more than once. 

You can type.  Investigate data-entry jobs.  You won't make 50K, but you need to acclimate to working first.

Comment body: My nervous breakdown happened my "last" semester of college. It lasted for 9 months. I averaged 3 hours of sleep per week. I was hallucinating and my entire life flash before my eyes. I had photo like clarity of each bad thing that I regretted all pouring in. 

The stuff that helped me heal from it is now preventing me from "adjusting" back into "modern society." 

My reaction times are shot, I feel like I live a ground hog day existence, but I also am somewhat fearless. Like I have walked on the highway without blinking. I don't really understand. My emotions are selective.

Comment body: Op, before you get a job, you need to look into getting on disability (at least temporarily) and getting into therapy.

You've got some serious stuff going on that you need some professional help with.

I'm not saying that to demean you. I'm saying that as someone who's in therapy for childhood trauma and anxiety.
