Title:why do degrees for technicians exist if they are useless?
URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/s52mz4/why_do_degrees_for_technicians_exist_if_they_are/
I keep being told my tech degree will be useless, that I'm not getting a "real degree" and so on because it ends with "technology" when I want to be a technician. 

Ive tried getting a technician role without a degree and it didn't work out. I just don't get all the hatred for technician degrees. Are they really that much of a waste of time?

Comment body: Who said that "technology" degrees are useless for technicians?  They are the absolute gold standard for technicians.

  Where you hear the "technology degrees are useless" arguments are when people want to go into engineering, but then get an "engineering technology" degree rather than a straight up engineering degree.  Even then the statement is exaggerated, but at least there's some truth to it in that scenario.

Comment body: Man, all the people i know who got BS in engineering technology all got great engineering  jobs…..

Hurts because engineering killed me. ET was waaaaaay easier

Comment body: Don’t know where you went to school but at mine (US school) we took MOSTLY the same classes under the same professors. It really only deviated in the last like 3 semesters or so. ME might take a mat sci 2 where as MET would take a mat sci lab (or something very similar). 

I guess it really depends on the school and the curriculum. Curriculum should honestly be the standard.

Comment body: I hear that’s a really good school for engineering technology? Most of them only do technician level things? At my old company we had a few Purdue guys fresh out of school doing engineering with an MET degree. Major respect to those guys. They were fun and highly intelligent.

Comment body: I think less intense is the wrong way to word it. Bachelors in Manufacturing tech / electronic systems tech have more labs than traditional engineering degrees. 

The main difference isn't time spent learning but the type of learning, MEEN goes deeper into theory and math where as MMET goes deeper into the industry relevant things like  manufacturing processes and autonomous systems. 

This is one of the issues I saw at my university. People who got traditional engineering degrees had a tendency to look down on those getting the technology degrees however they both put in about the same amount of work only in different ways.

The saddest part for many of the traditional engineering degree seekers is when they see an MMET get $80k + OT compensation right out of college when the traditional degree seeker is getting $65k - $75k with no additional compensation for overtime. 

I've seen a few MMET grads clear ~$120k in their first year on the job working 50 hour weeks in jobs they love. 

TLDR: Academia isn't industry and industry is all that matters.

Comment body: So key points to touch: 

1) Purdue isn't the only respected University with a Mechanical Engineering Technology Program. IE: Texas A&M has several and most ABET accredited public universities in Texas have them as well. I'm sure they exist at well respected schools across the nation. Also highly recommend familiarizing yourself with specialized technology degrees like welding engineering technology from Ferris State University; welding engineers from their program make bank and have an engineering skill set you won't find from most schools. 

2) In most if not all cases, if a university has a respected program for traditional Mechanical / Electrical where they also offer a technology version, the technology will be respected as well.  

3) A bachelors engineering technology degree from an ABET accredited university gets you engineering jobs not technician jobs. Persons graduating from 2 year programs at smaller schools get technician jobs. 

4) I've seen the Technology students spend just as much time as the regular students. In many cases exposure bias plays a huge role here, but it could also be that Purdue has a less rigorous technology degree (however I doubt that's the reason). 

5) Don't assume that salaried engineers can't get paid overtime - that's just outright incorrect. There is a huge number of companies that pay engineers overtime. At all of the companies I've interned / worked at engineers were OT eligible and in all of those positions OT required manager approval. Honestly these are the good companies I will admit - some companies both underpay and overwork their engineers and that's unfortunate. Though that does happen, it doesn't mean it's representative of all engineering jobs. AERO companies, Oil/ Gas Companies, some tech companies, and most manufacturing companies pay engineers overtime. 

Also congrats on technical sales, I hear the pay and freedom in those positions are generally very good.
