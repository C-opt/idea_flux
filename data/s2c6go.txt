Title:Why are employers asking if the commute works for me?

I've submitted several online applications on Indeed recently that asked "Does the commute time to their workplace work for you?" I just have to ask, who comes up with these questions? **Why would I apply if the commute time didn't work for me?**

Comment body: More jobs should be wfh honestly. If its not customer facing, and the work software and data can be safely download and transferred via external internet servers, I don’t see why places are still pushing for in office. 

Send people home, get a smaller office space for things that need to be done in office, save $$, make employees happy. 

But maybe I am too naive?

Comment body: No, you’re not naive. It’s leadership at most companies that seem to think we need to be in the office to be productive. Fuck that, I’m used to being remote at this point. More productive than ever. And I’m not wasting 2 hours of my fucking day commuting.

Comment body: Seoul, Tokyo, Singapore, London. Any capital city or tier2 city in Europe would also have a functioning public transit system.

Bay Area...hmm... from personal experience, you'll still need a car even if you commute to work on public transit

Seoul, hell South Korea as a whole has an amazing public transit system.

Pretty much every other developed country in the world BUT America it feels like. XP
