Title:Company Said I would get a Promotion in 6 Months but Now Says No?

 I joined on at a company that was starting a project I am very familiar with, so they hired me on at a good rate. They said the team would be expanding a lot and getting new members, which it has, and I would get a promotion to "lead" a group of 3-4 as we get larger and larger.

Fast forward to 6 months to when this was supposed to happen and my boss says doesn't look like he can do it because HR and "I don't fit the list of requirements", mostly meaning I haven't been in the position for 3 years.

Now, what nobody else knows, is that I recorded my interview where they told me I would get promoted at the 6 month mark. Now, I'm pretty sure that is illegal, but I literally have proof they told me (which they now deny, btw). Obviously, I don't want to show them because you can't legally record people w/o consent. How should I go about this?

Comment body: This is the only thing "bad" in the job though. I just don't have the title. Everything else is good..

I also forgot to mention that I'm already leading people: they come to me with questions, I keep them on track with deadlines, etc...

Comment body: That's a massive "bad" though. They lied to you and are screwing you over. The leadership of the company will never change. It will only get worse as time goes on.
