Title:I’m so frustrated. The job market is so saturated with applicants that are overqualified, it’s impossible to get a job.

Came here to vent/ISO support. Ive been trying to find a new job as a Paralegal (mid-level). I’ve been applying on Indeed, Craigslist, Glassdoor, etc. I’ve set up notifications so I can be alerted and apply right away. I’m more than qualified for the jobs that I apply to and I’ve been sending in stellar cover letters. I’ve been getting responses here and there from hiring managers who make initial contact then say, “sorry we’ve decided not to hire ATM” or some other excuse. 

I’ll check the status of my applications on Indeed and, no joke, it says 1,500+ applicants applied for the same job. Of those 1,500 applicants there are probably 50+ applicants that have their JD and can’t pass the bar or don’t want to work as attorneys. I know this because I helped my current firm hire a receptionist and many of those applicants had a JD too.

Comment body: Persistence. That is the only answer.

It sucks. It sucks it sucks it sucks it sucks. Believe me. I just went through 8 months of constant rejections. I know exactly how you feel.

The baffling moments of like "I'm CLEARLY QUALIFIED FOR THIS ROLE. WHY WON'T YOU HIRE ME?!" etc

I totally get it
