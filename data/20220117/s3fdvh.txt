Title:My new employer CANCELED my signed contract before my first day WHILE I WAS ON A PLANE.
URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/s3fdvh/my_new_employer_canceled_my_signed_contract/
So after searching for a tech job for MONTHS, doing countless interviews, getting rejected over and over again, I finally got an offer. I eagerly accepted and did the whole onboarding stuff. Then while I am on a damn plane, I get a call that they actually cannot accept me and basically canceled my contract like that. Then they offered me $500 compensation for this. Oh did I tell you that I also gave my two week notice and I was supposed to start at my new job? Yeah. Awesome. Really awesome. Any advice?

update: consulting a lawyer and cannot answer anymore so i won't hurt my potential case. when it is ok to do so i will answer questions though. for now thread is closed.

Comment body: If you’re in the US, it’s highly unlikely you can do anything. But just in case, DO NOT accept the $500 and do not sign anything until after you speak to a lawyer.

Comment body: Whether we like it or not, it costs money to do business. When you're obtaining a service from someone, it's costing them money to perform that service for you.

Expecting to receive payment to recoup the costs of these services isn't priveledged.

Comment body: What *is* privileged is your comment that considers none of it. If someone just told you this story, and this is your reply, it’s either privileged or cluster b. Idc if you agree or not, it’s definitely how you come across.

It's not privileged to understand that using someone's services typically requires some form of compensation.

The particular situation doesn't change the fact that providing those services to people costs those businesses money. They can't do it all for free, because their doors wouldn't stay open very long if they did.

Comment body: Did it ever occur to you i May be talking about the situation in general, and the fact that lawyers aren’t required to do pro bono to keep them (more) honest and in touch with the common masses? Ofc not, as evidenced by your replies. Hit dog holla, as the saying goes.
