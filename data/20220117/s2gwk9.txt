Title:When rejecting a shitty recruiter, don't say "please withdraw my application". Say "I will no longer be moving forward with this opening."

"I want to withdraw" is submissive language that leaves the recruiter in the decision-making position. Remember, the interview process is as much for you to evaluate the prospective employer as it is for them to evaluate you. If/when you decide to reject the recruiter, take away the illusion that the recruiter has any choice in the matter.

Edit: recruiters seething in the comments. Lots of salt to mine.

Edit 2: Another fun option is to turn their own rejection boilerplate back at them.

Comment body: Ugh, this subreddit just keeps pumping out the snake oil. Job searching can be a barren hellscape, but it's posts like these that make it very apparent that many of the people here don't actually know what they're talking about, are probably their own worst enemy, and probably aren't good candidates to begin with.

Hell, this statement isn't even true,

*"I want to withdraw" is submissive language that leaves the recruiter in the decision-making position."*

That isn't submissive language, and it doesn't leave them in the decision making position when **the candidate is the person withdrawing their candidacy.**

The differences in these two titular phrases don't mean a damn thing to a recruiter; they're equivalent. It's just "on to the next one." If you want to tell the recruiter explicitly, directly, but **TACTFULLY FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T REALIZE THAT WORD CAN GET AROUND ABOUT YOU, RECRUITERS DO TALK, AND THAT \*YOU'RE A BRAND\* AND SHOULD CARRY YOURSELF AS SUCH** then by all means do so, but please don't think you're dunking on someone by essentially choosing between two virtually equivalent phrases.

Comment body: I want to point out someone else posted under this subreddit that withdrawal from an application to move forward with another job was met with the recruiter threatening to tell unemployment insurance that they rejected them so they'd no longer receive UI. Idk man it doesn't sound like snake oil when it's met with that kind of statement.

Comment body: Is assertive language so alien to you it comes off as whining or do you have self esteem low enough to believe assertion is aggression? I'm not interested in an answer but I'm sure a therapist out there might be :3 cheers

This has **absolutely nothing** to do with the conversation so far. How is it related to anything?

Comment body: So are you practicing willful ignorance or just being ignorant here? What they said is relevant and either way you're a *complete moron* for not comprehending how.
