Anyone else just look at former coworker's or people's LinkedIn profiles to see where they've gone?

I'm generally happy with my life and the choices with which I've made thus far. However, there are some days where I just go on a binge and reminisce about the previous jobs I've had, and more importantly, the people I used to work with. Although we never were close, we weren't complete strangers as well. They were people I've worked with, gosh darn it. They were people I had to learn how to communicate with, tackled projects together, and spent time with. They have made me the person I am today, so in some sense, I am thankful for them.

&#x200B;

Today, I spent close to about 15 minutes just looking at people's LinkedIn pages, to see the jobs they've held prior to us working together, and where they have gone since post. While I'm set in my career and starting something fresh and anew in the summer of this month, I still can't help but shake and compare.   


I'm wondering if this is a solo-act, or commonality. Thanks!
