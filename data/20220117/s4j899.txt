Hi Everyone,
I will be making the jump into HR from a “career” in education. I have a BA in history and MA in Education. I will be receiving my BS in HR Management in 2023. I currently work at Target and have no HR experience. I have a few quick questions.
1. Where should I be looking for entry level positions? Should I be looking for entry level positions?
2. Should I leave my Master’s degree of my resume? I don’t want a potential employer to be scared off thinking I would be too expensive.

Comment body: I would try to pivot to a Learning & Development corporate role. That is close to HR and has a lot of overlap with you education bachelor. You could go from there..

Comment body: Is L&D similar to training? I’m a technical writer and I’m looking for something a little different. This might be a logical jump for me as well.
