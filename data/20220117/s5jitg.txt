Title:What skills can make a mechanical engineer more competitive?
URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/s5jitg/what_skills_can_make_a_mechanical_engineer_more/
I am a recent mechanical engineer grad and I have been working for about 8 months. I hate my current position because it's not real engineering. It's just reports and coding with an outdated programming language. I'm applying to other positions but the process is so slow. So what skills do you think a fresh graduate should try to learn? I'm currently trying to learn R programming for positions that require data analysis skills.

Comment body: This is going to be industry specific, and I’m simplifying quite a bit here when I say this…

Knowing how to use a screwdriver.

Comment body: Really? Knowing how to turn a screwdriver makes you more competitive? 

Here's the real answer to the question: learn programming than leave for the software  with twice the pay and half the work

Comment body: Why is every Redditors solution to everything just "learn programming"? Not everyone wants to be a programmer.

Comment body: Even if you want to stay an engineer knowing embedded software will make you 10000x more competitive than "knowing how to tighten bolts".
 
Every single thread like this there's always a bunch of engineers who haven't applied for new grad positions in a decade who think "new grad engineers don't know HoW tO woRK wiTH THEiR haNDS.” Like learning some literal basic shit you can train techs to do in 1 day would make them more competitive lol

Comment body: The knowledge you gain isn't tightening bolts. It's understanding that that bolt hole shouldn't go there because the wrench can't reach it and things that go along with that, like not using a bolt as a locating feature (beyond maybe flatheads because they self center from the cone). Knowing that stuff results in better parts that are easier and faster to assemble, thus resulting in cheaper production and less complaining from production about idiot engineers.

So no, it's not basic shit you can train techs to do in 1 day. It's the experience of cursing the dickhead engineer who put the hole in the most annoying spot possible. It's the difference between the parts that are reasonable makeable and the parts that are ridiculously stupid.
