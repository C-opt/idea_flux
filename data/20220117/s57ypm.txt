Comment body: simple, I don't do them and ask whether it's possible to do a 1h technical phone screen (aka DS&A/leetcode style interview) instead
  
oh you're going to reject me based on that? no problem I got literally 20+ other interviews to schedule who are all going to ask me DS&A, I don't mind withdrawing from yours

Comment body: On top of that, those companies should be named and shamed here. 

I'll start

Society6 - after a long take home, they still wanted to waste my time with 4 more follow up interviews over zoom. They kept saying they wanted to move fast, yet they didn't stop to think that maybe a single follow up call with everyone on the call would waste less time. 

I ended that train wreck of a peocess and took a different offer.

Comment body: JetFuel. They gave me a take home assignment in which I completed all the requirements, and then outsourced the reviewing process to a 3rd party that rated my work “great” instead of “excellent.” Their comment was I named a variable “p” in a foreach instead of “person”. Don’t get me wrong I understand the importance of good naming convention but we had 3 hours to complete this assignment and a foreach is very easy to read.

So then I get an automated reply saying sorry we only accept “excellent candidates.”

Comment body: hahaha this is really sad. I remember I blocked a recruiter because they wanted me to fetch data from twitter API and I told them I never used twitter API so applying to get access will take some time..they didnt believe it. I told them check yourselves. Then they change the question to fetch from fb or instagram and I told them no longer interested. What kind of companies that never update their question? if they didnt care about it, they never reallt care about hiring process
