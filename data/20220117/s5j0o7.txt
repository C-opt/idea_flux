Title:Would this be considered wrongful termination?
URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/s5j0o7/would_this_be_considered_wrongful_termination/
I started working in a lab in late November. During the interview, my boss asked me when I plan on applying to grad school and I told her it was a future thought but not something I’m thinking about right now. She then asked if I would be able to commit to at least a year or two to them and I said yes. This was a lie. I had already submitted my grad school applications for fall 2022. I was told not to say this because then I wouldn’t have gotten hired. 
It is now January and I have received a couple interview invites from schools. I feel like I should tell her before she somehow finds out from the schools in case they decide to contact her to confirm my employment or something. I also think giving her enough of a heads up would benefit her if she wants to start looking for someone else to hire. I can still work there till like July or August until I leave for grad school in the fall. I am terrified of telling her this news and don’t know how she’s going to react. I’m planning on telling her that I decided to apply just to see how competitive I was AFTER I got hired, so I don’t seem like I lied during the interview. 
My question is, would she be in the wrong to terminate me after disclosing this info? I don’t think she would because she pretty much needs me and I am still being signed off on things so firing me would be a waste of training. But maybe she could find someone to replace me, have me train them, and then let me go? Would that be considered wrongful termination? Idk I’m just nervous lol and I also just don’t want her to hate me. I don’t know how to go about this.

Comment body: Laws vary by state, but firing you for being untruthful during an interview doesn’t sound like unlawful termination to me.

I would not recommend letting her know that you will be starting school in August until it no longer matters what her reaction is.  If you’re feeling generous, give them a month notice.  Two weeks is standard, and anything more puts you at risk.

Comment body: She wouldn’t know I was being untruthful since I’m gonna tell her I decided to apply after the fact. I wasn’t planning on telling her about this until I had a confirmed offer from a program. But now I’m thinking there’s a possibility that she might find out from the program if they decide to contact her and it definitely wouldn’t be a good look for me if she finds out from them and not me. So idk

Comment body: Is the lab you’re working at part of a different school, or is it a private business?  If it’s part of a college, I could see them calling, but if it is a private business, I doubt they will call for a reference.

Comment body: Unfortunately, I am employed by a university and work at an off-campus lab. And to make things even more difficult, one of the schools that is interviewing me is actually the university I work for. So I can definitely see them contacting my boss to confirm. They don’t know about this yet because when I applied to the program I hadn’t started working for that lab yet, but that’s something I’m definitely going to have to mention to them during the interview. 

Oh also, I work in Maryland but am employed by a university in DC.

Comment body: That does make it a little more complicated.  How is the relationship with the boss?
If you went to school at the university where you’re employed could you stay on part time?  Perhaps get free (or reduced) tuition and fees as an employee?
You’re certainly under no obligation to tell your boss 7 months before you might leave.  If she does get a call and asks you about it, you can tell her you recently applied and are just considering your options.

Comment body: The relationship is definitely good! She’s a nice lady and I know she likes me, but our interactions are limited to work stuff so it’s not like we have any sort of relationship. I would be doing a PhD program so there’s no way I would have the time to work for this lab when I start :/. I really just want to wait until I’m about to leave but I’m too worried that her finding out from the programs themselves would reflect poorly on me to both the program and my boss

Comment body: I wouldn’t worry about that.  Do the best job you can while you’re there and leave on good terms when the time comes.  

Good people will treat you fairly.  They know that life happens and people move on.
