Title:Who else resigned and regretted it?
URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/s4prjb/who_else_resigned_and_regretted_it/
I resigned with no back up plan. Once the excitement wore off and I couldn't get another job, I realized I was f***ed. One of the things that influenced me is my close friend telling me the job market is really good right now and it's easy to find another job. She STILL hasn't changed her mind about this despite her watching me struggle for a year to find a job. She's not even out looking for a job which pisses me off why people who don't know the struggle even voice their opinions. 

Anyway, it was a good lesson learned. It is NOT easy finding a good paying job, even with all the skills I developed in the last 7 years of my old job. I'm VERY grateful for my new job, I definitely earned it after 30 or so rejected interviews. However it's an entry level job and not as high paying as my old one and not full time. Heck, it's even a lot more work than my old one.

The thing about this whole great resignation spiel does not apply to every job sector. This applies to a large portion that is frontline workers in industries such as restaurant, retail, and hospitality that are quitting and attempting to change into a less soul crushing career. Imagine this, you have people quitting bad job en masse to find better jobs. What will you get in the end? Good jobs having significantly MORE applicants than usual due to a larger pool of competitors. We definitely do not have any shortage of workers for cushy white collar jobs.
