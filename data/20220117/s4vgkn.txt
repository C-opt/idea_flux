Title:Have any of you actually been hired through LinkedIn/Indeed, etc. since the pandemic started?

Just curious. I've applied to dozens of jobs on there in the last year and didn't get anywhere (creative field). My partner has been applying in a non-creative field and has gotten a handful of interviews and job offers. 

Have any of you actually found a job this way in the last couple years? If so, what is your field? What do you think got you the job? I'm also curious to hear from people who had a similar experience as me.

Comment body: I see people bitch about LinkedIn all the time on here and don't understand why. The format is WAY better than Indeed, and I like that they tell you when a recruiter has viewed your application/downloaded your resume. I've gotten 10 interviews from there and 1 job offer in the last 3 months of casually applying to about 30 jobs/week.

I usually go the Easy Apply route because.... it's easy. Every job I applied for via a company website has never resulted in anything.
