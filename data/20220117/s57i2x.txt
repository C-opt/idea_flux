Title:Suggestions for dark, quiet, lonely jobs?
URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/s57i2x/suggestions_for_dark_quiet_lonely_jobs/
Hello. I've just graduated high school and need to get a job. I suffer from headaches (I have a headache for at least 90% of the day, every day). Because of this, I would prefer a job which is quiet and dark. Most jobs that my friends have (retail, fast food) are very bright and require talking to people.

I'm in a west coast urban area.

Any ideas?

Edit: not on a computer too cause that makes my headache a lot worse.

Edit two: just woke up and wow, thank you for all the advice. I've seen basically every kind of doctor I can with no success so it's unlikely I'll be getting better anytime soon. I'm going to look into security (hopefully it's not too spooky) and maybe some other night shift jobs as well. 

I hope everyone who shared advice has a fantastic day, I really appreciate the ideas.

Comment body: I hope you can get some medical advice because that's certainly not normal. Night shifts might be for you, for example night time security at a business or mall would be quiet and dark.

Comment body: Night shifts are a good idea. I don't mind being nocturnal either. I'll look into it.

Comment body: I suffer with the same problem OP and I came here to comment to work night shift as a security officer. That’s basically all I can do for work as of late. I was on Topiramate for a while and it stopped my migraines, but it has absolutely terrible side effects. So if this drug is ever recommended, decline it. Although all drugs react differently with various people.

Comment body: Actually I did try topiramate and had 0 relief as well as 0 side effects. Kinda funny how different people react to the same drug .

Im definitely gonna look into security jobs as long as it's not too dangerous.

Also hang in there cause headaches suck. Sending u my highest quality vibes :)

Comment body: Topiramate was *awful* for me as well. I don't know if you've been to a neurologist yet, but they'll work with you generally until they find a medicine that worked. I took low doses of Keppra for a few years, which was mostly good but if I forgot B6, I had anxiety attacks. It also made me crazy sleepy. He gave me good ideas as to triggers. Suspected the root cause might be age (hormones) and weight. Given a couple of years and the loss of a few pounds, I'm down to menstrual migraines again.

I hope you feel better soon. It's so hard. I second night security or overnight janitorial stuff.

Edit as well to add that if this is hindering you to a certain point, a neurologist will also be your first stop for disability if you need it. If I recall, mine told me any migraine lasting over 15 days for three months (or something like that) qualifies as chronic migraine, which could also mean disability. This does come with the caveat that my migraines give me vertigo so bad that I can't walk or drive, but that would be a conversation to have with your doctor and possibly a lawyer.

Comment body: My neurologist is who subscribed the Topiramate. I have to go back and try something else, I’ve been considering getting Botox.
