Title:My offer got rescinded after I asked if I can stay remote
URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/s2usjf/my_offer_got_rescinded_after_i_asked_if_i_can/
I got an offer recently from a mid-sized company that advertised a remote position. After I received the offer, I was told it was "company policy" to go back into the office once everything re-opens. I live 5 hours away from the HQ. I told HR that this would be a big decision for me, and that I would have to either leave my family or make them all move out with me, and then asked if there was any possibility that I could stay remote after re-opening. Didn't get any response after that email. Instead, I got an automated email that said that my offer was voided. Seriously? Fuck HR. It's so depressing. I was actually excited to join the company too.

Edit: I'm not planning on reviewing in Glassdoor or naming and shaming because it's too recent and I don't wanna risk getting doxxed at the moment. I'm sorry if I sound paranoid, but I wanna play it safe and give them the review in a few months from now.

Comment body: They were never planning to be remote in the first place and just force their decision when people no longer have the choice.
Such when they’ve already resigned from their other job.

Shitty company.

Comment body: That’s why you have everyone in debt. Mortgages, student loan, car finance, buy now pay later.

You do not want to play by the rules? You lose the house, your wife will despise you and get a divorce.
Your neighbour will look down on you.

It’s a clever system of oppression with a carefully knitted narative.

Id you have to work 40h weeks and do not have the freedom of place and time, you are mostly a slave.

Aa, and health insurance, encouraging employers to provide it, that is clever as well.

Comment body: Settle down there comrade. A 21st century middle class life is hardly oppression. No one forced you to take out those loans or buy that house/car. You can't rack up a huge tab and then start complaining that the system is unfair when the bill comes

Comment body: Inflation is theft, and moving capital from working class to rulling class, how much is that inflation now? In reality? 7-10%? 
How long will it take for people to depleate their savings? Not long.

You can’t save anymore. If you were able to do 10-20% of your salary, shortly you won’t.

Hope that answers your question.

You are 100% correct. I've been saying this for years. The problem is people keep voting for politicians that implement policies that make inflation worse (and I'm not just talking about the current crop, this has been going on for decades). "Democracy is the theory that the public know what they want, and they deserve to get it good and hard"

However, to call American-style capitalism oppressive is a little far. North Korea is oppressive. Cuba is oppressive. Our society is just imperfect.

Comment body: It is with a bit more steps. There are very good concepts that exist there, only that they get bypassed by other legislation.

I don’t think we have free markets for employees, I think we should start with that. Destabilising the asymmetrical power employers have through transparancy, free opportunity and wages that can afford to save.

And also some minimum basic income thet emplpyees should have after centuries of industrial progression. Not only the employers ripping the benefits and everyone else threatened with starvation.

But I am not sure how soon we can have that…

Still oppression…

No. Absolutely not. This is exactly what I mean about people bitching about inflation but then turning around and advocating for policies that would only make it worse.

Also, I really dislike the way you use the language of free markets to try to advance explicitly anti-free market ideas. I'm not really one for reddit buzzwords, but that is the exact definition of a bad faith argument. You are trying to trick people into agreeing with ideas that are far more radical than they realize

Comment body: Have you heard of ‘bullshit jobs’ ? David graeber has a good book.
There aren’t enough jobs to go round so gov and some employers make some up. Economy is booming, people lack meaning because their jobs were not supposed to have one. So they keep spinning the hamsterwheel until they die.

Some people should be allowed to not work.

That's Keynesian nonsense. The government should not be "making up" jobs for people. I'm not saying it doesn't happen, just that it shouldn't

>Some people should be allowed to not work.

Everyone is "allowed" to not work, but I'll be damned if I'm gonna support you lazy NEETs financially.

Lmao, no offense, but your sophomoric advocacy for UBI is hardly breaking new intellectual ground for me. The problem with running any sort of charity through the government is that the aid becomes an entitlement. You are not entitled to anything- not food, not water, not shelter, etc. I have no problem helping people who have legitimately fallen on hard times, but I am not waking up and going to work at 8 am every morning just so I can pay for an able-bodied 25 yo to sit home and play video games. The whole anti-work/UBI movement is a bunch of immature kids wanting to get something for nothing and trying to obscure their selfishness with pseudo-intellectual rationalization

Comment body: Not sure if you are quite there with the logic.

If you watch RT news, you’ll see that Rusian propaganda towards the west is the actual truth. Because that is the most effective thing.
So if you watch RT news, you are more likely to learn the truth about current events in the west than mainstream media.
Quite ironic…

You are just confused…
