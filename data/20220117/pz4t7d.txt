Edit: I screwed up the macro for this post, the title should be Q4 2021. It has been fixed for next year!

# Intro

Welcome to the AskEngineers quarterly salary survey! This post is intended to provide an ongoing resource for job hunters to get an idea of the salary they should ask for based on location and job title. Survey responses are NOT vetted or verified, and should not be considered data of sufficient quality for statistical or other data analysis.

So what's the point of this survey? We hope that by collecting responses every quarter, job hunters can use it as a supplement to other salary data sites like the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Glassdoor and PayScale to negotiate better compensation packages when they switch jobs.

## Useful websites

For Americans, BLS is the gold standard when it comes to labor data. A guide for how to use BLS can be found in our wiki:

* [*How do I figure out how much salary to ask for? (U.S. only)*](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_figure_out_how_much_salary_to_ask_for.3F_.28u.s._only.29)

We're working on similar guides for other countries. For example, the Canadian counterpart to BLS is [StatCan](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/start), and [DE Statis](https://www.destatis.de/EN/Themes/Labour/Labour-Market/Employment/_node.html) for Germany.
