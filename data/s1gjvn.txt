Title:Why did you even contact me?

Them:   Hi, I hope you are doing good. I have a job opening of Senior IT Auditor at Canada/Remote with our direct client. Please share your resume at (name) (phone) (email)

Me:  I currently make X, with X bonus, and X RSU, and I live in San Francisco. Would your client actually hire an American resident living in an expensive remote city?

Them:  Actually we are hiring for only who are in Canada.

Me: so why did you message me? Did you even read my profile before asking for a resume?

&#x200B;

I'm not surprised, I've been asked by recruiters to apply for a job I was fired from.

The answer here is a resounding NO. They are cold messaging you hoping something will stick. Block these lazy recruiters emails and on LinkedIn.
