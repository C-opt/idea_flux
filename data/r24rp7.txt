Yannic Kilcher's thoughts on the 2021 NeurIPS reviewer experiment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEh1GR0t29k

Frankly, I agree with him completely. The review process is completely broken and arbitrary. Yes, phenomenal papers get accepted; but this is a given, and phenomenal papers will get traction whether they are published at a peer-reviewed venue or not. However, the sheer level of randomness with regards to the "good but not phenomenal" papers is a searing condemnation of the review process itself. And, as Kilcher discusses, it completely invalidates the notion of "publishing as a metric of value" with respect to PhD students, tenure track professors, grant applications, etc.

Comment body: At the very least, peer review ensures a minimum quality of each accepted paper.

That in itself is already valuable

Comment body: Honestly doesn’t even seem that bad, “ Extend that to the full conference: if we assume 25% acceptance rate, then 13% of all submissions are accepted because they're really good. 13% are accepted because they're lucky, 13% are rejected because they're unlucky and 60% are rejected because they're not good enough. Honestly, it's way better than what I expected, and I'm not sure the process can be improved very much.” To quote David Picard.

Comment body: Those percentages seem optimistic. The 73% rejected could all argue that they're unlucky, theoretically. I assume there's more to this quote..?
