Hi, just as the title states

What do you do in the situation where its the norm to leave references on your resume when applying for new jobs BUT your only references that you have are those at your current job where you do not want them to know you are looking for new jobs? 

Lets say that the place that you're applying to calls your current employer asking how you are but you end up not getting the job at the new place, now your current employer knows you're not staying.

What to do in my situation? Surely someone has been in my shoes before. Thanks for any feedback/advice I can get!!
