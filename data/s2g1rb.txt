Title:[D] Is AI research reaching saturation?
URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/s2g1rb/d_is_ai_research_reaching_saturation/
It feels like every topic is heavily researched. There are 100 new papers everyday mentioning small improvements to previous architectures/models with some tweaking. Every task has a near 100% accuracy. Is AI research reaching saturation? What do you guys work on, and how competitive is it in your area? How do you keep up with the several papers cpming in everyday?

Comment body: Yes, there are a ridiculous number of papers on classifying image-net categories, segmenting road lines, and generating pictures of faces etc.

However, virtually no progress has been made on "real" AI. The ability to reason about and respond to meaningfully novel stimuli remains uniquely human, the ability to one-shot learn solutions to complex tasks remains uniquely human. Research towards these goals is still entirely unsaturated imo.

Comment body: "Real AI" is always a moving target. It always has been and it will likely always be. A lot of it is because it is a marketing term.

My favorite quote:

From 2002: [https://www.wired.com/2002/03/everywhere/](https://www.wired.com/2002/03/everywhere/)

"Every time we figure out a piece of it, it stops being magical; we say, 'Oh, that's just a computation,'" laments Rodney Brooks, the director of MIT's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. "We used to joke that AI means 'almost implemented.'"

Comment body: I don‘t think it’s ever been that much of a moving target. We just can’t define it well, so we define it by proxy.

There’s some definition we mostly have in mind, like “C3-PO style AI” for example. But we don’t have an actual solid definition of this shared idea, so we say here are some attributes of C3-PO. If an algorithm has those attributes, it must be a C3-PO style AI! So we finally build an algorithm with those attributes, and it’s not a C3-PO style AI, so we say those attributes weren’t really C3-PO style AI.

Some people say that means C3-PO style AI is a moving target. I’d say that means the same old target was misunderstood.

Comment body: C-3PO is a robot that can chat with you, with the drawback being low intelligence (compared to a normal human or R2-D2) and, sometimes, it being annoying. GPT-3 is in the right ballpark?

Comment body: C-3PO was a protocol droid and could speak 3 million languages.
