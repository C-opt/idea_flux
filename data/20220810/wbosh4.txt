Comment body: japan and many other countries which were invaded by the usa didn t choose to have a democracy the fact that usa park democratic governments in all of their colonies tells you everything you need to know about freedom in democratic countries usa themselves offer no freedom of choice it is a plutocracy you can t run for president unless you are unbelievably well connected and backed by powerful companies then there s russia as another beautiful example of contemporary free and independent democracy and turkey it was probably easier to overthrow kings back in the days than subvert any modern democracy

Comment body: the japanese contistution dates back to 1947 two years after the atomic bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki pretty much like the italian controversial referendum and constitution date back to 1946 and 1948 respectively these two great countries lost the war and became american colonies that s all in your propagandistic view of history japanese people adore baseball and have become renowned blue jeans makers by mere chance i completely disagree with that nonsense because yukio mishima wasn t a fool he killed himself because he has seen his homeland and his national culture be wiped away by an ignorant and oppressive enemy

Comment body: i m not that guy but the current japanese constitution was written by the us during occupation and the us installed war criminals in high ranking positions in korea and japan because they were sympathetic to the us including abe s grandfather these countries are not democracies by choice in fact korea voted for a communist assembly before usamgik refused to acknowledge the election and installed former colonial officials in a puppet democracy which is what led to the korean war

Comment body: the assertion from the other dude who even brought this up was that the us forced democracy on japan and that s simply not true japan had a democratic constitution in place 50ish years before ww2 started that s why the meiji constitution is being brought up it doesn t matter if it s not the current constitution in effect

Comment body: what are you talking about japan has a parliament system like the uk the japanese people vote for parliament members the parliament members vote on a prime minister and the prime minister is ceremoniously appointed by the emperor that was pretty much how the japanese government was prior to ww2 except the emperor had more power back then emperors tend to not be elected by the people so i d argue the people have more power now than back then

Comment body: look man i m not interested in taking part in a conversation when all you re going to do is respond in bad faith idk how much clearer i can be the original claim being made was the us forced democracy onto japan after ww2 and that s clearly not true since japan had democratic monarchy since the late 1800s everything else is beyond that also i checked your comment history and you don t appear to have anything to do with japan you spend a lot of time in r denvercirclejerk and other us based subreddits so maybe you should stop speaking for japanese citizens on how they feel about their government

Comment body: so maybe you should stop speaking for japanese citizens on how they feel about their government   late in the evening on may 19 kishi took the desperate measure of suddenly and unexpectedly calling for a 50 day extension of the diet session in defiance of longstanding parliamentary norms and over the opposition of many members of his own ruling liberal democratic party   ldp 17   when socialist diet members staged a sit in in the halls of the diet kishi took the unprecedented step of calling 500 police officers into the diet chambers and having opposition lawmakers physically removed from the premises 18   thereafter with only members of his own party present he passed the extension of the diet session a final shock came after midnight just after the extension was approved when kishi then called for immediate ratification of the treaty with only members of kishi s own party present the revised security treaty was approved by the lower house of the diet with no debate and only a voice vote

Comment body: strange i m not see any estimates of how many people attended these protests to compare with the japanese population of the time not that these protests don t have merit the us has military bases in a bunch of foreign locations when they wouldn t stop responding to me
