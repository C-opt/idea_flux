Comment body: not unsurprising the only way to get out of this is through increasing immigration which i m not sure how you do if you are currently projecting your country as foreigner unfriendly this is and will continue to be a huge problem for japan aging population ultra low birth rate and not enough immigration

Comment body: increased immigration is certainly necessary too but i would argue that japan needs to overhaul social norms around work life balance and also drastically reform social support and the entire health and childcare systems for new parents and newborn children it s frankly amazing to me that pregnancy isn t covered by healthcare ostensibly because it isn t an illness and i ve found many of the norms at the local hospitals and the madness of the childcare system upsetting to say the least compared to my home country i m not surprised people are having less children in this environment

Comment body: i think they re both important but there are deep problems in the health and childcare systems that would immediately benefit everyone if fixed so if i really had to rank them i would probably put that first

Comment body: totally agree if cultural and or governmental norms are grinding down a population to the point where people are actively choosing not to start families then why would immigrants a flock to that place and then b choose to start families in other words the government should attempt to shape an environment where anyone including the existing population would want to raise kids

Comment body: also all governments should be looking at adapting to a world in which populations are either shrinking or remaining stable basing laws pensions housing gdp and whatnot on the idea that the population will always be increasing is shortsighted
