Comment body: the bigger problem is in mindshare the japanese government s awful border restrictions have i soured foreign residents in japan on the country after locking them in during 2020 and ii soured those who were interested in japan on the country after locking them out from 2020 to ongoing those people would have been some of the biggest advocates for japan internationally especially in academia as in the article instead they ve probably turned their attention elsewhere korea is becoming mighty popular recently what japan has lost isn t something you earn back quickly

Comment body: not meaning to belittle your position in any way but you re a someone on the internet and b one data point against literally every foreign resident i know i also don t know any foreign residents who get multiple annual visits with their parents you must realize that this alone makes you quite the outlier

Comment body: you re a rando on the internet but my opinion as a rando on the internet is valid and i don t get multiple visits from my family i ve seen then once since 2019 the ideal for me is to be able to have them visit and me visit them freely and one of those japan just refuses to let happen

Comment body: i was pretty explicit that i wasn t trying to invalidate what you ve said and the comment was made in the context of my previous comment that i ve met literally zero foreign residents who ve expressed these feelings my point was not that people with these feelings don t exist but that i question how widespread they are on a statistical level or are my experiences invalid as a rando on the internet

Comment body: you re not a more credible rando than this other rando anecdotes doesn t mean anything there are 2 89 million expats in japan and 170 000 exchange students all of those students were mostly likely sent home and you reckon being forced out of such a unique country as japan would leave those same students thinking eh this doesn t bother me i just lost my tuition and was openly discriminated against by the government that hosted me
