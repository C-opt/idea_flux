Comment body: your comment boils down to might makes right which is a common belief shared between the us and china the developed world has for the most part moved past that way of thinking eventually and very unfortunately the ccp will get too big for their britches and will end up having to be put in their place either that or the entire country will economically implode due to their looming demographic nightmare broken political system and economic numbers based largely on lies

Comment body: yes the world will need to do it the us will be a big part using their bases in japan with japanese support taiwan will obviously be a huge part it s likely it will involve other smaller powers both in apac and probably from further afield much like what is happening in ukraine but with more direct involvement china isn t wrong until someone checks them for it also that is not at all what i said sounds like something you would say though
