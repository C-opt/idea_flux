I want to get healthier/leaner and find a new hobby/socialize.
What sports do you do in Tokyo? And where? 
I tried pilates today, was pretty good!

Comment body: honestly if you spent 40 50 000 on a hybrid bike a lot of those hills would just disappear and your range would increase massively i was floored how fast hybrid bikes were when i first got one then i bought a roadbike hybrid bikes btw look like mountain bikes but with thinner tyres and less chunky frames it s a bit of an investment and have a bit of cash at hand but if you re into fitness it s almost a nobrainer

Comment body: take a look at the giant escape and trek fx lineup they re really solid bikes if you plan to do some longer rides e g over an hour then you might want to get a road bike instead which has a handlebar and brake system that allows for more hand positions which is more comfortable for longer durations they are also slightly faster due to putting you in a more aerodynamic position which might be more fun if you re on a budget then you may want to consider used bikes shops like buychari and cycle paradise do comprehensive checks and have good prices you will also need to budget for a helmet at least one set of cycling clothes a pump maintenance tools and some replacement parts unless you pay a local shop to do this all for you
