Comment body: there isn t a single study that looked at mask wearing preventing covid and successfully concluded they work justifying their mass usage mask wearing works against other viruses such as the flu and cold since they are spread by droplets covid is spread visa dry air particles aerosols think cigarette smoke i e if you can smell through your mask you can catch covid while wearing a mask japan has had the most relaxed lockdown measures in the world and people don t wear masks when they eat or drink etc one can only conclude it wasn t masks no matter how much people want to believe it is when they mistake correlation for causation
