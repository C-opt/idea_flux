Title:Solo travelling as young female
URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/japanlife/comments/wi7f62/solo_travelling_as_young_female/
I’ve finally got some time off work and want to do some travelling, in my car, alone. Is it safe? I know Japan is safer than most countries for females travelling, and I’ve travelled alone before elsewhere, I’m just curious to hear experiences from other woman who have done so in Japan.

Second, tips for travelling on a budget in a car? I’m aware of [this](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1ZBVjXbJKXFgt7AFBFQlSn5Zx3to&hl=en_US&ll=35.32118448148417%2C137.067787&z=9) map showing Michi no eki and free (apparently?) camp grounds to stay at, but what do you guys use for finding cheap hostels etc? I don’t want to slum it in the car every night, besides I think it may be a little too hot these days…

Lastly, my plan is to travel chubu area, departing from Shizuoka and heading northwest through the likes of aichi, Gifu, Toyama etc and finishing up in Kutatsu in gunma before heading back home. Anyone who’s done a chubu trip, what would you recommend? I only have shirakawago, hido no sato in mind.m tbh. I’d quite like to visit echizen though it is a bit out of the way (fan of murasaki Shikibu). I like history and nature mostly, and less so big cities

Thanks in advance!

Comment body: are you visibly foreign because that matters here i ve had some pretty alarming experiences in rural japan men pulling over their cars to ask me out others trying to force me into their cars at midnight some just stopping on the street and refusing to let me go i d personally be wary of camping alone solo travel in general is safe but bad people are everywhere and having a door you can lock at night is a basic precaution
