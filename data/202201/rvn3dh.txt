Hey everyone! I’m one of the creators of [Sieve](https://sievedata.com/), and I’m excited to be sharing it!

Sieve is an API that helps you store, process, and automatically search your video data–instantly and efficiently. Just think 10 cameras recording footage at 30 FPS, 24/7. That would be 27 million frames generated in a single day. The videos might be searchable by timestamp, but finding moments of interest is like searching for a needle in a haystack.

We built this visual demo ([link here](https://sievedata.com/app/query?api_key=AIzaSyAfKwf0tuuNOHbYi_JX-ew_dXH6SzdxZWY)) a little while back which we’d love to get feedback on. It’s \~24 hours of security footage that our API processed in <10 mins and has simple querying and export functionality enabled. We see applications in better understanding what data you have, figuring out which data to send to labeling, sampling datasets for training, and building multiple test sets for models by scenario.

Comment body: Off-topic question, but I'm genuinely interested. How do you live with yourself, knowing what this technology is inevitably going to be used for, almost exclusively? We all know this is surveillance tech, we can pretend there are some cool other uses that will see significant use. But at the end of the day, how do you relax and be ok with what you're contributing to the world? Thanks, I'll take my answer without any other comment.

Comment body: Well, you can’t really stop technology’s advancement. It is going to happen, so might as well get on board. Key isn’t stopping the tech, it is proper use/restrictions.

Comment body: Stop funding and instantly it will not advance. Technology doesn’t have a mind of its own, it’s bounded by society and our economical and political decisions.

Comment body: But that's the problem. Just like the use of violence itself, it is a simple inevitability that bad actors exist. The total refusal of using violence from all good people will only lead to bad people dominating through their uninhibited, unchecked violence.

You're right that technology does not have a mind of its own, but you're forgetting that there are 7 billion minds in this world, which leads to much the same consequences.

Comment body: Pretty strange assumption that 7 billions are able to push the state of the art without resources.

Comment body: China alone accounts for 1b+ and certainly has no qualms advancing SotA for use in surveillance.

Comment body: I'm confused, are 1b+ researchers and anyway even if they were, will they work without funding?

Comment body: At this point you're intentionally being obtuse. The CCP will fund surveillance research no matter what anybody, inside or outside of China, will protest. They also have the power to "incentivize" their desired research in many ways that do not involve money.

If Western governments thought as you did and forbade any research relating to state surveillance, the short-term outcome would be leaving Chinese citizens to fend for themselves in finding countermeasures against surveillance, and in the long-term, a Chinese monopoly on global surveillance.
