Title:I am so sick of hearing no's

I just want a good job, my first job. It seems like it is impossible to find, every single application is just a door that gets slammed in my face. I have been told time and time again that I am smart and something will come. I know they mean well but I am SICK OF HEARING THAT. WANNA KNOW WHY I HAVE NO EXPERIENCE? BECAUSE NO ONE WILL HIRE ME. I have gone as far as to put projects on my resume to show that I can do it and that I am a fast learner. I even have a master's degree for Pete's sake but no one will touch me for some reason. I don't get it what am I doing wrong?  I have reached out to recruiters sent a million applications out but nothing.  I am trying not to be too picky but this is getting discouraging.

Comment body: You aren't finding the right mentor then. I am not sure what your masters is but doing things like informational interviews about the field is a great way to network and understand how people started themselves.

Comment body: Thought about that and one big reason why I didn’t. The damn tests you have to pass. I have the worst test anxiety

Comment body: You were able to get through a masters in math but you won’t consider a certain career field because of test anxiety? How did you pass college then lol
