Title:Is it bad to leave your current company for a better company after only 5~6 months of work
URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/s1havp/is_it_bad_to_leave_your_current_company_for_a/
I’m a recent grad of 2021, my first full time developer job out of college is at a big financial firm and been here about 5 months, but now my previous manager from my summer internship at a giant tech company messaged me about a role he is considering for me which made me really excited.

I don’t mind my current company, but it’s kind of cut throat, but I really liked my previous manager and the giant tech company where I interned, and plus the compensation for the tech company is about 15k more than here. 

Does it look bad on my resume to switch companies after about 5~6 months to return to the company I interned for previously? Should I go for it?

Only if you make it a habit; doing it once isn't an issue.

Comment body: And how many times is considered a habit over let’s say 10 years of employment

Comment body: There is no discreet number that suddenly makes hiring managers label you as a job hopper. It just gets progressively harder the more often you do it.

Comment body: In past ten years I did switch 4 times but I also spent 5 years at one place which made employers realize that if I find the right match, then I’m going to stick. In short, it depends

Comment body: Yeah, I agree. My personal rule is:

Two years+: Requires no explanation at all (and you probably won’t even be asked about it). 

Between one and two years: You *might* get asked why you’re leaving “so soon.”

Under one year: I (personally) feel like I would need a “good” answer to explain why I want to leave so soon after starting. 

And what I mean when I say a “good answer” is: If you’re leaving in less than a year, the company you’re applying to *may* be concerned that you suck and you’re worried you’re about to be fired from your current place (so that’s why you’re interviewing at other places). So you need a compelling answer to reassure them that the problem isn’t you (whatever that answer is).

Comment body: Also depends on YOE. 1-2 years no one will blink an eye if you're a junior. Probably even mid level. At senior level if you have a history of leaving every year or so that might raise eyebrows. At least this is what my mentor at my last company told me when we talked about it. He reassured me I shouldn't feel bad about leaving to greener pastures and explained why he as a distinguished engineer needs to be more careful about leaving jobs.

Comment body: Agreed. But I think that the pattern is more important than anything else in that situation. 

Example: If you have 10 years experience and you got a new job every 2 years. Well, people who interview you will think you will only stay for 2 years.
