URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/s27mwz/just_found_out_that_i_m_being_severely_underpaid/
Today I found out that I'm getting paid 30%-40% less than my peers even worse because I have more responsibilities and way more productive I'm literally bringing more money to this company,I have no words why they did this to me,  I was given 200% on stress periods I'm totally crushed.

Some background :  I started working for this company as an intern, then I got hired after couple months  then got a small raise, ever since my salary been stagnant for a year now  and I have spent a total of 1 year and a half at this company.

Please help what to do ? I'm very very very angry ...

PS:   Nothing  against the guys that get paid more than me I wish them good luck I just feel stupid and disrespected by the company.  


Edit: Woohoo didn't expect this  to blow up, I wish I could thank every single one of yall for your advice, encouragement and unapologetic feedback.  


You helped me come to the conclusion that it was my fault for loving the job too much and not actively negotiating my salary thinking that they love me back and that they'll take care of me!   


I know exactly what I need to do now,  thank you so much, you kind souls.

Comment body: Companies don't pay you based on your productivity. They pay you based on what you negotiate for compensation.

If you want more money you have to ask for more money. You will probably need a counter offer or a new gig to jump 40% though.

Comment body: This is bad advice. Every company/manager is different and they very well might care depending on where you work.

Comment body: Managers, may care. For sure. However their hands are tied. NO COMPANY WILL CARE. NONE. Their goal is to make as much money as possible. That means paying as little as possible.

Comment body: Personal anecdote, but I got about 4 pay raises over the course of 3.5 years just by asking for more with a competing job offer in hand.

YMMV. I stayed every time, as the company was great. I helped it grow from 25 employees to 125+, sell for millions, and then got paid cause I had equity in the company. And no, before you ask, I would not have lost the shares upon leaving.

My current company, which is a private school also adjusts pay to keep us up with market rate, but you have to ask to have your salary adjusted. They aren't really focused on making the most money either, as they have consistently locked tuition year-over-year to make it easier on the students while other schools raised it.

Comment body: Interesting. So they didn't penalize you for bringing competing offers to them or anything? I've heard that once you do that, they try to replace you, but I'm not sure how credible that advice was lol.

Comment body: I'm 10+ YOE and anyone who tells you it's always one way is wrong. It depends heavily on so many variables that are unique to each job that no one experience can be representative of all others.

No penalty for bringing it up, just more pay and money for professional development. I'm in a market where demand is high for devs, so I've never really had any problem getting what I've asked for. I'm not greedy by any means, just market rate please. My other benefits, like 7 weeks off PTO and 10% 401k match make it a great job.
