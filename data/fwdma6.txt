Title:New post requirement. Please use location flairs.
URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/fwdma6/new_post_requirement_please_use_location_flairs/
Hello r/careerguidance,

I've added a new ability for people to flair their posts with their location to help get better targeted advice. I can make this a requirement in much the same way that a "?" is required in the tile but I'd prefer to not add more barriers to posting.

If anyone has feedback or other suggestions please let me or the other mods know, and feel free to use this thread to talk about the subreddit.

Edit: I'm an idiot and forgot to enable everyone to actually **use** the new flair. should be good now.

Comment body: I think it's cool, but I don't know if it should be a requirement because I feel like a lot of the advice in this sub can be applied to any job market in any location. I think a good addition to the locational flairs would be career flairs, and job seeking flairs as well.

PS I still can't set my flair lol

Comment body: Yeah the requirement part was dropped already. There are already some other types of categories. Which post are you having trouble with setting it on?

Comment body: I'm sorry, I misunderstood what you wrote to mean user flairs.

I think user flairs could be cool, though.

Comment body: I'd say both can be.

From my experience, most Redditors seem to post what they want without selecting flairs or even reading the rules. While these are super useful tools to help people find what they're looking for and create order in a sub, many people seem to disregard that.

I personally love flairs, I love flairing my posts and user on any sub I post in lol. I feel that post flairs help distinguish between "types" of posts, while user flairs help to distinguish between things like credentials, occupation, job seeking status, etc.

You can try both and see which one users gravitate to :)
