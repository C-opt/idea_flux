Comment body: Looking for info about an architecture which takes into account data from a sequence of images (ie. A video...) And uses it when doing image segmentation.
In theory i am thinking of "nerrowing down the search" for the area (and "size"?) where the objects where in the last frame... 
Looked around but o keep finding ROI tracking approaches and not segmentation


Thanks for any pointers :)

I'll definitely try and update :)

Comment body: Dude, that's what 3D convolutions are FOR. See here for example: [https://pytorchvideo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/models/resnet.html](https://pytorchvideo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/models/resnet.html)
